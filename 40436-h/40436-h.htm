<h3>ALKIBIADES I. &mdash; ON THE NATURE OF MAN.</h3>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_1" id="Sidenotev2_12_1"></a> Situation supposed in the dialogue. Persons &mdash; Sokrates and Alkibiades.</span></p>

<p>This dialogue is carried on between Sokrates and Alkibiades. It introduces Alkibiades as about twenty years of age, having just passed through the period of youth, and about to enter on the
privileges and duties of a citizen. The real dispositions and circumstances of the historical Alkibiades (magnificent personal beauty, stature, and strength, high family and connections, great wealth
already possessed, since his father had died when he was a child, &mdash; a full measure of education and accomplishments &mdash; together with exorbitant ambition and insolence, derived from such
accumulated advantages) are brought to view in the opening address of Sokrates. Alkibiades, during the years of youth which he had just passed, had been surrounded by admirers who tried to render
themselves acceptable to him, but whom he repelled with indifference, and even with scorn. Sokrates had been among them, constantly present and near to Alkibiades, but without ever addressing a word
to him. The youthful beauty being now exchanged for manhood, all these admirers had retired, and Sokrates alone remains. His attachment is to Alkibiades himself: to promise of mind rather than to
attractions of person. Sokrates has been always hitherto restrained, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page2" id="v2page2"></a>2</span>by his divine sign or D&aelig;mon, from speaking to Alkibiades.
But this prohibition has now been removed; and he accosts him for the first time, in the full belief that he shall be able to give improving counsel, essential to the success of that political career
upon which the youth is about to enter.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_1" href="#Footnotev2_12_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_12_1" id="Footnotev2_12_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_12_1">1</a></span> Plato, Alkib. i. 103, 104, 105. Perikles is supposed to be still alive and
political leader of Athens &mdash; 104 B.</p>

<p>I have briefly sketched the imaginary situation to which this dialogue is made to apply. The circumstances of it belong to Athenian manners of the Platonic age.</p>

<p>Some of the critics, considering that the relation supposed between Sokrates and Alkibiades is absurd and unnatural, allege this among their reasons for denying the authenticity of the dialogue.
But if any one reads the concluding part of the Symposion &mdash; the authenticity of which has never yet been denied by any critic &mdash; he will find something a great deal more abnormal in what
is there recounted about Sokrates and Alkibiades.</p>

<p>In a dialogue composed by &AElig;schines Socraticus (cited by the rhetor Aristeides &mdash; &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &#8172;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8134;&sigmaf;, Or. xlv. p.
23-24), expressions of intense love for Alkibiades are put into the mouth of Sokrates. &AElig;schines was &gamma;&nu;&#942;&sigma;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&#7953;&tau;&alpha;&#8150;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf; &Sigma;&omega;&kappa;&rho;&#940;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;, not less than Plato. The different companions of Sokrates thus agreed in their
picture of the relation between him and Alkibiades.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_2" id="Sidenotev2_12_2"></a> Exorbitant hopes and political ambition of Alkibiades.</span></p>

<p>You are about to enter on public life (says Sokrates to Alkibiades) with the most inordinate aspirations for glory and aggrandisement. You not only thirst for the acquisition of ascendancy such as
Perikles possesses at Athens, but your ambition will not be satisfied unless you fill Asia with your renown, and put yourself upon a level with Cyrus and Xerxes. Now such aspirations cannot be
gratified except through my assistance. I do not deal in long discourses such as you have been accustomed to hear from others: I shall put to you only some short interrogatories, requiring nothing
more than answers to my questions.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_2" href="#Footnotev2_12_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_3" id="Sidenotev2_12_3"></a> Questions put by Sokrates, in reference to Alkibiades in his intended function as adviser of the Athenians. What does he
intend to advise them upon? What has he learnt, and what does he know?</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You are about to step forward as adviser of the public assembly. Upon what points do you intend to advise them? Upon points which you know better than they? <i>Alk.</i>
&mdash; Of course. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; All that you know, has been either learnt from others or found out by yourself. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Certainly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But you would neither have
learnt any thing, nor found out any thing, without the desire to learn or find out: and you would have felt no such desire, in respect to that which you believed yourself to know already. That which
you now know, therefore, there was a time when you believed yourself not <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page3" id="v2page3"></a>3</span>to know? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Necessarily so. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; Now all that you have learnt, as I am well aware, consists of three things &mdash; letters, the harp, gymnastics. Do you intend to advise the Athenians when they are debating about letters,
or about harp-playing, or about gymnastics? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Neither of the three. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Upon what occasions, then, do you propose to give advice? Surely, not when the Athenians are
debating about architecture, or prophetic warnings, or the public health: for to deliver opinions on each of these matters, belongs not to you but to professional men &mdash; architects, prophets,
physicians; whether they be poor or rich, high-born or low-born? If not <i>then</i>, upon what other occasions will you tender your counsel? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; When they are debating about affairs
of their own.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_4" id="Sidenotev2_12_4"></a> Alkibiades intends to advise the Athenians on questions of war and peace. Questions of Sokrates thereupon. We must fight
those whom it is better to fight &mdash; to what standard does better refer? To just and unjust.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But about what affairs of their own? Not about affairs of shipbuilding: for of that you know nothing. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; When they are discussing war and peace, or any other
business concerning the city. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You mean when they are discussing the question with whom they shall make war or peace, and in what manner? But it is certain that we must fight
those whom it is best to fight &mdash; also <i>when</i> it is best &mdash; and <i>as long as</i> it is best. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Certainly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now, if the Athenians wished to know
whom it was best to wrestle with, and when or how long it was best which of the two would be most competent to advise them, you or the professional trainer? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; The trainer,
undoubtedly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; So, too, about playing the harp or singing. But when you talk about <i>better</i>, in wrestling or singing, what standard do you refer to? Is it not to the gymnastic
or musical art? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Yes. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Answer me in like manner about war or peace, the subjects on which you are going to advise your countrymen, whom, and at what periods, it
is <i>better</i> to fight, and <i>better</i> not to fight? What in this last case do you mean by <i>better</i>? To what standard, or to what end, do you refer?<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_3" href=
"#Footnotev2_12_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I cannot say. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But is it not a disgrace, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page4" id="v2page4">
</a>4</span>since you profess to advise your countrymen when and against whom it is better for them to war, &mdash; not to be able to say to what end your <i>better</i> refers? Do not you know what
are the usual grounds and complaints urged when war is undertaken? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Yes: complaints of having been cheated, or robbed, or injured. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Under what circumstances?
<i>Alk.</i> &mdash; You mean, whether justly or unjustly? That makes all the difference. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do you mean to advise the Athenians to fight those who behave justly, or those who behave
unjustly? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; The question is monstrous. Certainly not those who behave justly. It would be neither lawful nor honourable. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then when you spoke about <i>
better</i>, in reference to war or peace, what you meant was <i>juster</i> &mdash; you had in view justice and injustice? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; It seems so.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_5" id="Sidenotev2_12_5"></a> How, or from whom, has Alkibiades learnt to discern or distinguish Just and Unjust? He never learnt it from any one; he
always knew it, even as a boy.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How is this? How do you know, or where have you learnt, to distinguish just from unjust? Have you frequented some master, without my knowledge, to teach you this? If you have,
pray introduce me to him, that I also may learn it from him. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; You are jesting. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Not at all: I love you too well to jest. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; But what if I had
no master? Cannot I know about justice and injustice, without a master? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Certainly: you might find out for yourself, if you made search and investigated. But this you would not
do, unless you were under the persuasion that you did not already know. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Was there not a time when I really believed myself not to know it? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Perhaps there may
have been: tell me <i>when</i> that time was. Was it last year? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; No: last year I thought that I knew. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Well, then two years, three years, &amp;c., ago? <i>
Alk.</i> &mdash; No: the case was the same then, also, I thought that I knew. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But before that, you were a mere boy; and during your boyhood you certainly believed yourself to
know what was just and unjust; for I well recollect hearing you then complain confidently of other boys, for acting unjustly towards you. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Certainly: I was not then ignorant on the
point: I knew distinctly that they were acting unjustly towards me. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page5" id="v2page5"></a>5</span><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You knew, then, even in your boyhood, what
was just and what was unjust? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Certainly: I knew even then. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; At what moment did you first find it out? Not when you already believed yourself to know: and what
time was there when you did not believe yourself to know? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Upon my word, I cannot say.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_6" id="Sidenotev2_12_6"></a> Answer amended. Alkibiades learnt it from the multitude, as he learnt to speak Greek. &mdash; The multitude cannot teach
just and unjust, for they are at variance among themselves about it. Alkibiades is going to advise the Athenians about what he does not know himself.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Since, accordingly, you neither found it out for yourself, nor learnt it from others, how come you to know justice or injustice at all, or from what quarter? <i>Alk.</i>
&mdash; I was mistaken in saying that I had not learnt it. I learnt it, as others do, from the multitude.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_4" href="#Footnotev2_12_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; Your teachers are none of the best: no one can learn from them even such small matters as playing at draughts: much less, what is just and unjust. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I learnt it from them as
I learnt to speak Greek, in which, too, I never had any special teacher. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Of that the multitude are competent teachers, for they are all of one mind. Ask which is a tree or a
stone, &mdash; a horse or a man, &mdash; you get the same answer from every one. But when you ask not simply which are <i>horses</i>, but also which horses are fit to run well in a race &mdash; when
you ask not merely about which are <i>men</i>, but which men are healthy or unhealthy &mdash; are the multitude all of one mind, or all competent to answer? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Assuredly not. <i>
Sokr.</i> &mdash; When you see the multitude differing among themselves, that is a clear proof that they are not competent to teach others. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; It is so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now,
about the question, What is just and unjust &mdash; are the multitude all of one mind, or do they differ among themselves? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; They differ prodigiously: they not only dispute, but
quarrel and destroy each other, respecting justice and injustice, far more than about health and sickness.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_5" href="#Footnotev2_12_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> How,
then, can we say that the multitude know what is just and unjust, when they thus fiercely dispute about it among themselves? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I now perceive that we cannot say so. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page6" id="v2page6"></a>6</span>How can we say, therefore, that they are fit to teach others: and how can you pretend to know, who have learnt from no other
teachers? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; From what you say, it is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_7" id="Sidenotev2_12_7"></a> Answer farther amended. The Athenians do not generally debate about just or unjust &mdash; which they consider plain to

he can do nothing but question.</span></p>

<p><i>Alk.</i> &mdash; But, Sokrates, the Athenians do not often debate about what is just and unjust. They think that question self-evident; they debate generally about what is expedient or not
expedient. Justice and expediency do not do not always coincide. Many persons commit great crimes, and are great gainers by doing so: others again behave justly, and suffer from it.<a name=

expediency are not coincident. Persuade <i>me</i> of this, by interrogating me as I interrogated you. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; That is beyond my power. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But when you rise to address

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_8" id="Sidenotev2_12_8"></a> Comment on the preceding &mdash; Sokratic method &mdash; the respondent makes the discoveries for himself.</span></p>

<p>Such is the commencing portion (abbreviated or abstracted) <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page7" id="v2page7"></a>7</span>of Plato&rsquo;s First Alkibiad&ecirc;s. It exhibits a very
characteristic specimen of the Sokratico-Platonic method: both in its negative and positive aspect. By the negative, false persuasion of knowledge is exposed. Alkibiades believes himself competent to
advise about just and unjust, which he has neither learnt from any teacher nor investigated for himself &mdash; which he has picked up from the multitude, and supposes to be clear to every one, but
about which nevertheless there is so much difference of appreciation among the multitude, that fierce and perpetual quarrels are going on. On the positive side, Sokrates restricts himself to the
function of questioning: he neither affirms nor denies any thing. It is Alkibiades who affirms or denies every thing, and who makes all the discoveries for himself out of his own mind, instigated
indeed, but not taught, by the questions of his companion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_9" id="Sidenotev2_12_9"></a> Alkibiades is brought to admit that whatever is just, is good, honourable, expedient: and that whoever acts honourably,
both does well, and procures for himself happiness thereby. Equivocal reasoning of Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>By a farther series of questions, Sokrates next brings Alkibiades to the admission that what is just, is also honourable, good, expedient &mdash; what is unjust, is dishonourable, evil,
inexpedient: and that whoever acts justly, and honourably, thereby acquires happiness. Admitting, first, that an act which is good, honourable, just, expedient, &amp;c., considered in one aspect or in
reference to some of its conditions &mdash; may be at the same time bad, dishonourable, unjust, considered in another aspect or in reference to other conditions; Sokrates nevertheless brings his
respondent to admit, that every act, <i>in so far as it is just and honourable</i>, is also good and expedient.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_10" href="#Footnotev2_12_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> And
he contends farther, that whoever acts honourably, does well: now every man who does well, becomes happy, or secures good things thereby: therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page8" id=
"v2page8"></a>8</span> the just, the honourable, and the good or expedient, coincide.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_11" href="#Footnotev2_12_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The argument, whereby this
conclusion is here established, is pointed out by Heindorf, Stallbaum, and Steinhart, as not merely inconclusive, but as mere verbal equivocation and sophistry &mdash; the like of which, however, we
find elsewhere in Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_12" href="#Footnotev2_12_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

Alkibiades is to measure himself, are, the kings of Sparta and Persia. Eulogistic description of those kings. To match them, Alkibiades must make himself as good as possible.</span></p>

<p>Alkibiades is thus reduced to a state of humiliating embarrassment, and stands convicted, by his own contradictions and confession, of ignorance in its worst form: that is, of being ignorant, and
yet believing himself to know.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_13" href="#Footnotev2_12_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> But other Athenian statesmen are no wiser. Even Perikles is proved to be equally
deficient &mdash; by the fact that he has never been able to teach or improve any one else, not even his own sons and those whom he loved best.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_14" href=

reminds him that the real competitors with whom he ought to compare himself, are foreigners, liable to become the enemies of Athens, and against whom he, if he pretends to lead Athens, must be able
to contend. In an harangue of unusual length, Sokrates shows that the kings of Sparta and Persia are of nobler breed, as well as more highly and carefully trained, than the Athenian statesmen.<a

which object cannot be attained except through the auxiliary interposition of Sokrates. Not that Sokrates professes to be himself already on this elevation, and to stand in need of no farther
improvement. But he can, nevertheless, help others to attain it for themselves, through the discipline and stimulus of his interrogatories.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_16" href="#Footnotev2_12_16"><span

<p>The dialogue then continues. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; We wish to become as good as possible. But in what sort of virtue? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; In that virtue which belongs to good men. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; Yes, but <i>good</i>, in what matters? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Evidently, to men who are good in transacting business. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Ay, but what kind of business? business relating to
horses, or to navigation? If that be meant, we must go and consult horse-trainers or mariners? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; No, I mean such business as is transacted by the most esteemed leaders in Athens.
<i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You mean the intelligent men. Every man is good, in reference to that which he understands: every man is bad, in reference to that which he does not understand. <i>Alk.</i>
&mdash; Of course. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The cobbler understands shoemaking, and is therefore good at <i>that</i>: he does not understand weaving, and is therefore bad at that. The same man thus, in
your view, will be both good and bad?<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_17" href="#Footnotev2_12_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; No: that cannot be. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Whom then do you
mean, when you talk of <i>the good</i>? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I mean those who are competent to command in the city. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But to command whom or what &mdash; horses or men? <i>Alk.</i>
&mdash; To command men. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But what men, and under what circumstances? sick men, or men on shipboard, or labourers engaged in harvesting, or in what occupations? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash;
I mean, men living in social and commercial relation with each other, as we live here; men who live in common possession of the same laws and government. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; When men are in
communion of a sea voyage and of the same ship, how do we name the art of commanding them, and to what purpose does it tend? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; It is the art of the pilot; and the purpose towards
which it tends, is, bringing them safely through the dangers of the sea. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; When men are in social and political communion, to what purpose does the art of commanding them tend? <i>
Alk.</i> &mdash; Towards the better preservation and administration of the city.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_18" href="#Footnotev2_12_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But what do you
mean by <i>better</i>? What is that, the presence or absence of which makes <i>better</i> or <i>worse</i>? If in regard to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page10" id="v2page10">
</a>10</span>management of the body, you put to me the same question, I should reply, that it is the presence of health, and the absence of disease. What reply will you make, in the case of the city?
<i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I should say, when friendship and unanimity among the citizens are present, and when discord and antipathy are absent. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; This unanimity, of what nature is it?
Respecting what subject? What is the art or science for realising it? If I ask you what brings about unanimity respecting numbers and measures, you will say the arithmetical and the metr&ecirc;tic
art. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I mean that friendship and unanimity which prevails between near relatives, father and son, husband and wife. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But how can there be unanimity between any
two persons, respecting subjects which one of them knows, and the other does not know? For example, about spinning and weaving, which the husband does not know, or about military duties, which the
wife does not know, how can there be unanimity between the two? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; No: there cannot be. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Nor friendship, if unanimity and friendship go together? <i>Alk.</i>
&mdash; Apparently there cannot. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then when men and women each perform their own special duties, there can be no friendship between them. Nor can a city be well administered, when
each citizen performs his own special duties? or (which is the same thing) when each citizen acts justly? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Not so: I think there may be friendship, when each person performs his or
her own business. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Just now you said the reverse. What is this friendship or unanimity which we must understand and realise, in order to become good men?</p>

&mdash; its anticipated effect &mdash; applicable to the season of youth.</span></p>

<p>Here we have again, brought into prominent relief, the dialectic method of Plato, under two distinct aspects: 1. Its actual effects, in exposing the false supposition of knowledge, in forcing upon
the respondent the humiliating conviction, that he does not know familiar topics which he supposed to be clear both to himself and to others. 2. Its anticipated effects, if continued, in remedying
such defect: and in generating out of the mind of the respondent, real and living knowledge. Lastly, it is plainly intimated that this shock of humiliation and mistrust, painful but inevitable, must
be undergone in youth.</p>

<p>The dialogue continues, in short questions and answers, of which the following is an abstract. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What is meant by a man <i>taking care of himself</i>? Before I can take care of
myself, I must know what myself is: I must <i>know myself</i>, according to the Delphian motto. I cannot make myself better, without knowing what <i>myself</i> is.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_20" href=

<p>The other Platonic dialogue, termed the Second Alkibiades, introduces Alkibiades as about to offer prayer and sacrifice to the Gods.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_18" id="Sidenotev2_12_18"></a> Danger of mistake in praying to the Gods for gifts which may prove mischievous. Most men are unwise. Unwise is the
generic word: madmen, a particular variety under it.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You seem absorbed in thought, Alkibiades, and not unreasonably. In supplicating the Gods, caution is required not to pray for gifts which are really mischievous. The Gods
sometimes grant men&rsquo;s prayers, even when ruinously destructive; as they <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page13" id="v2page13"></a>13</span>granted the prayers of &OElig;dipus, to the
destruction of his own sons. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; &OElig;dipus was mad: what man in his senses would put up such a prayer? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You think that madness is the opposite of good sense or
wisdom. You recognise men wise and unwise: and you farther admit that every man must be one or other of the two, &mdash; just as every man must be either healthy or sick: there is no third
alternative possible? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I think so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But each thing can have but one opposite:<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_27" href="#Footnotev2_12_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a>
to be unwise, and to be mad, are therefore identical? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; They are. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Wise men are only few, the majority of our citizens are unwise: but do you really think them
mad? How could any of us live safely in the society of so many mad-men? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; No: it cannot be so: I was mistaken. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Here is the illustration of your mistake. All men
who have gout, or fever, or ophthalmia are sick; but all sick men have not gout, or fever, or ophthalmia. So, too, all carpenters, or shoemakers, or sculptors, are craftsmen; but all craftsmen are
not carpenters, or shoemakers, or sculptors. In like manner, all mad men are unwise; but all unwise men are not mad. <i>Unwise</i> comprises many varieties and gradations of which the extreme is,
being mad: but these varieties are different among themselves, as one disease differs from another, though all agree in being disease and one art differs from another, though all agree in being
art.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_28" href="#Footnotev2_12_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_19" id="Sidenotev2_12_19"></a> Relation between a generic term, and the specific terms comprehended under it, was not then familiar.</span></p>

<p>(We may remark that Plato here, as in the Euthyphron, brings under especial notice one of the most important distinctions in formal logic &mdash; that between a generic between a term and the
various specific terms comprehended under it. Possessing as yet no technical language for characterising this distinction, he makes it understood by an induction of several separate but analogous
cases. Because the distinction is familiar now to instructed men, we must not suppose that it was familiar then.) <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page14" id="v2page14"></a>14</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_20" id="Sidenotev2_12_20"></a> Frequent cases, in which men pray for supposed benefits, and find that when obtained, they are misfortunes. Every one
fancies that he knows what is beneficial: mischiefs of ignorance.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Whom do you call wise and unwise? Is not the wise man, he who knows what it is proper to say and do &mdash; and the unwise man, he who does not know? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; Yes.
<i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The unwise man will thus often unconsciously say or do what ought not to be said or done? Though not mad like &OElig;dipus, he will nevertheless pray to the Gods for gifts, which
will be hurtful to him if obtained. You, for example, would be overjoyed if the Gods were to promise that you should become despot not only over Athens, but also over Greece. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash;
Doubtless I should: and every one else would feel as I do. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But what if you were to purchase it with your life, or to damage yourself by the employment of it? <i>Alk.</i> &mdash;
Not on those conditions.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_29" href="#Footnotev2_12_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But you are aware that many ambitious aspirants, both at Athens and
elsewhere (among them, the man who just now killed the Macedonian King Archelaus, and usurped his throne), have acquired power and aggrandisement, so as to be envied by every one: yet have presently
found themselves brought to ruin and death by the acquisition. So, also, many persons pray that they may become fathers; but discover presently that their children are the source of so much grief to
them, that they wish themselves again childless. Nevertheless, though such reverses are perpetually happening, every one is still not only eager to obtain these supposed benefits, but importunate
with the Gods in asking for them. You see that it is not safe even to accept without reflection boons offered to you, much less to pray for boons to be conferred.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_30" href=
"#Footnotev2_12_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I see now how much mischief ignorance produces. Every one thinks himself competent to pray for what is beneficial to himself;
but ignorance makes him unconsciously imprecate mischief on his own head.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_21" id="Sidenotev2_12_21"></a> Mistake in predications about ignorance generally. We must discriminate. Ignorance of <i>what?</i> Ignorance of good,
is always mischievous: ignorance of other things, not always.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You ought not to denounce ignorance in this unqualified manner. You must distinguish and specify. Ignorance of what? and under what modifications of persons and circumstances?
<i>Alk.</i> &mdash; How? Are there <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page15" id="v2page15"></a>15</span><i>any</i> matters or circumstances in which it is better for a man to be ignorant, than to
know? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You will see that there are such. Ignorance of good, or ignorance of what is best, is always mischievous: moreover, assuming that a man knows what is best, then all other
knowledge will be profitable to him. In his special case, ignorance on any subject cannot be otherwise than hurtful. But if a man be ignorant things of good, or of what is best, in his case knowledge
on other subjects will be more often hurtful than profitable. To a man like Orestes, so misguided on the question, &ldquo;What is good?&rdquo; as to resolve to kill his mother, it would be a real
benefit, if for the time he did not know his mother. Ignorance on that point, in his state of mind, would be better for him than knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_31" href="#Footnotev2_12_31"><span

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_22" id="Sidenotev2_12_22"></a> Wise public counsellors are few. Upon what ground do we call these few wise? Not because they possess merely special
arts or accomplishments, but because they know besides, upon what occasions and under what limits each of these accomplishments ought to be used.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Follow the argument farther. When we come forward to say or do any thing, we either know what we are about to say and do, or at least believe ourselves to know it. Every
statesman who gives counsel to the public, does so in the faith of such knowledge. Most citizens are unwise, and ignorant of good as well as of other things. The wise are but few, and by their advice
the city is conducted. Now upon what ground do we call these few, wise and useful public counsellors? If a statesman knows war, but does not know whether it is best to go to war, or at what juncture
it is best &mdash; should we call him wise? If he knows how to kill men, or dispossess them, or drive them into exile, &mdash; but does not know upon whom, or on what occasions, it is good to inflict
this treatment &mdash; is he a useful counsellor? If he can ride, or shoot, or wrestle, well, &mdash; we give him an epithet derived from this special accomplishment: we do not call him wise. What
would be the condition of a community composed of bowmen, horsemen, wrestlers, rhetors, &amp;c., accomplished and excellent each in his own particular craft, yet none of them knowing what is good, nor
when, nor on what occasions, it is good to employ <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page16" id="v2page16"></a>16</span>their craft? When each man pushes forward his own art and speciality, without any
knowledge whether it is good on the whole either for himself or for the city, will not affairs thus conducted be reckless and disastrous?<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_32" href="#Footnotev2_12_32"><span
class="sp">32</span></a> <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; They will be very bad indeed.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_23" id="Sidenotev2_12_23"></a> Special accomplishments, without the knowledge of the good or profitable, are oftener hurtful than
beneficial.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If, then, a man has no knowledge of good or of the better &mdash; if upon this cardinal point he obeys fancy without reason &mdash; the possession of knowledge upon special
subjects will be oftener hurtful than profitable to him; because it will make him more forward in action, without any good result. Possessing many arts and accomplishments, and prosecuting one after
another, but without the knowledge of good, &mdash; he will only fall into greater trouble, like a ship sailing without a pilot. Knowledge of good is, in other words, knowledge of what is useful and
profitable. In conjunction with this, all other knowledge is valuable, and goes to increase a man&rsquo;s competence as a counsellor: apart from this, all other knowledge will not render a man
competent as a counsellor, but will be more frequently hurtful than beneficial.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_33" href="#Footnotev2_12_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> Towards right living, what we need
is, the knowledge of good: just as the sick stand in need of a physician, and the ship&rsquo;s crew of a pilot. <i>Alk.</i> &mdash; I admit your reasoning. My opinion is changed. I no longer believe
myself competent to determine what I ought to accept from the Gods, or what I ought to pray for. I incur serious danger of erring, and of asking for mischiefs, under the belief that they are
benefits.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_25" id="Sidenotev2_12_25"></a> Different critical opinions respecting these two dialogues.</span></p>

<p>The two dialogues, called First and Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s, of which I have just given some account, resemble each other more than most of the Platonic dialogues, not merely in the personages
introduced, but in general spirit, in subject, and even in illustrations. The First Alkibiad&ecirc;s was recognised as authentic by all critics without exception, until the days of Schleiermacher.
Nay, it was not only recognised, but extolled as one of the most valuable and important of all the Platonic compositions; proper to be studied first, as a key to all the rest. Such was the view of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page18" id="v2page18"></a>18</span>Jamblichus and Proklus, transmitted to modern times; until it received a harsh contradiction from Schleiermacher, who declared the
dialogue to be both worthless and spurious. The Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s was also admitted both by Thrasyllus, and by the general body of critics in ancient times: but there were some persons (as we

bears much analogy to several conversations which Xenophon has set down. But those who held this opinion are not to be considered as of one mind with critics who reject the dialogue as a forgery or
imitation of Plato. Compositions emanating from Xenophon are just as much Sokratic, probably even more Sokratic, than the most unquestioned Platonic dialogues, besides that they must of necessity be
contemporary also. Schleiermacher has gone much farther: declaring the Second as well as the First to be an unworthy imitation of Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_39" href="#Footnotev2_12_39"><span

<p>Here Ast agrees with Schleiermacher fully, including both the First and Second Alkibiades in his large list of the spurious. Most of the subsequent critics go with Schleiermacher only half-way:
Socher, Hermann, Stallbaum, Steinhart, Susemihl, recognise the First Alkibiad&ecirc;s, but disallow the Second.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_40" href="#Footnotev2_12_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> In my
judgment, Schleiermacher and Ast are more consistently right, or more consistently wrong, in rejecting both, than the other critics who find or make so capital a distinction between the two. The
similarity of tone and topics between the two is obvious, and is indeed admitted by all. Moreover, if I were compelled to make a choice, I should say that the grounds for suspicion are rather less
strong against the Second than against the First; and that Schleiermacher, reasoning upon the objections admitted by his opponents as conclusive against the Second, would have no difficulty in
showing that his own objections against the First were still more forcible. The long speech <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page19" id="v2page19"></a>19</span>assigned in the First Alkibiad&ecirc;s
to Sokrates, about the privileges of the Spartan and Persian kings,<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_41" href="#Footnotev2_12_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> including the mention of Zoroaster, son of
Oromazes, and the Magian religion, appears to me more unusual with Plato than anything which I find in the Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s. It is more Xenophontic<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_42" href=
"#Footnotev2_12_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> than Platonic.</p>

<p>But I must here repeat, that because I find, in this or any other dialogue, some peculiarities not usual with Plato, I do not feel warranted thereby in declaring the dialogue spurious. In my
judgment, we must look for a large measure of diversity in the various dialogues; and I think it an injudicious novelty, introduced by Schleiermacher, to set up a canonical type of Platonism, all
deviations from which are to be rejected as forgeries. Both the First and the Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s appear to me genuine, even upon the showing of those very critics who disallow them.
Schleiermacher, Stallbaum, and Steinhart, all admit that there is in both the dialogues a considerable proportion of Sokratic and Platonic ideas: but they maintain that there are also other ideas
which are not Sokratic or Platonic, and that the texture, style, and prolixity of the Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s (Schleiermacher maintains this about the First also) are unworthy of Plato. But if we
grant these premisses, the reasonable inference would be, not to disallow it altogether, but to admit it as a work by Plato, of inferior merit; perhaps of earlier days, before his powers of
composition had attained their maturity. To presume that because Plato composed many excellent dialogues, therefore all that he composed must have been excellent, is a pretension formally disclaimed
by many critics, and asserted by none.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_43" href="#Footnotev2_12_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> Steinhart himself allows that the Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s, though not composed
by Plato, is the work of some other author contemporary, an untrained Sokratic disciple attempting to imitate Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_44" href="#Footnotev2_12_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a>
But we do not know that there <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page20" id="v2page20"></a>20</span>were any contemporaries who tried to imitate Plato: though Theopompus accused him of imitating
others, and called most of his dialogues useless as well as false: while Plato himself, in his inferior works, will naturally appear like an imitator of his better self.</p>

very justly, but he as well as other critics are apt to forget it in particular cases.</p>

the dialogue to a later period. Heindorf (ad Lysin, p. 211) thinks it the work &ldquo;antiqui auctoris, sed non Platonis&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Steinhart and others who disallow the authenticity of the Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s insist much (p. 518) upon the enormity of the chronological blunder, whereby Sokrates and Alkibiad&ecirc;s are
introduced as talking about the death of Archelaus king of Macedonia, who was killed in 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, in the same year as Sokrates, and four years after Alkibiades. Such an
anachronism (Steinhart urges) Plato could never allow himself to commit. But when we read the Symposion, we find Aristophanes in a company of which Sokrates, Alkibiades, and Agathon form a part,
alluding to the &delta;&iota;&omicron;&#943;&kappa;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; of Mantineia, which took place in 386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> No one has ever made this glaring anachronism a
ground for disallowing the Symposion. Steinhart says that the style of the Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s copies Plato too closely (die &auml;ngstlich platonisirende Sprache des Dialogs, p. 515), yet he
agrees with Stallbaum that in several places it departs too widely from Plato.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_28" id="Sidenotev2_12_28"></a> The two dialogues may probably be among Plato&rsquo;s earlier compositions.</span></p>

<p>I agree with Schleiermacher and the other recent critics in considering the First and Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s to be inferior in merit to Plato&rsquo;s best dialogues; and I contend that their own
premisses justify no more. They may probably be among his earlier productions, though I do not believe that the First Alkibiad&ecirc;s was composed during the lifetime of Sokrates, as Socher,
Steinhart, and Stallbaum endeavour to show.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_45" href="#Footnotev2_12_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> I have already given my <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page21" id=
"v2page21"></a>21</span>reasons, in a previous chapter, for believing that Plato composed no dialogues at all during the lifetime of Sokrates; still less
in that of Alkibiad&ecirc;s, who died four years earlier. There is certainly nothing in either Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. or II. to shake this belief.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_12_45" id="Footnotev2_12_45"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_12_45">45</a></span> Stallbaum refers the composition of Alkib. i. to a time not long
before the accusation of Sokrates, when the enemies of Sokrates were calumniating him in consequence of his past intimacy with Alkibiades (who had before that time been killed in 404 <span class=
"smcap">B.C.</span>) and when Plato was anxious to defend his master (Prolegg. p. 186). Socher and Steinhart (p. 210) remark that such writings would do little good to Sokrates under his accusation.
They place the composition of the dialogue earlier, in 406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Steinhart, p. 151-152), and they consider it the first exercise of Plato in the strict dialectic method.
Both Steinhart and Hermann (Gesch. Plat. Phil. p. 440) think that the dialogue has not only a speculative but a political purpose; to warn and amend Alkibiades, and to prevent him from surrendering
himself blindly to the democracy.</p>

<p>I cannot admit the hypothesis that the dialogue was written in 406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (when Plato was twenty-one years of age, at most twenty-two), nor that it had any intended
bearing upon the real historical Alkibiades, who left Athens in 415 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> at the head of the armament against Syracuse, was banished three months afterwards, and never came
back to Athens until May 407 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Xenoph. Hellen. i. 4, 13; i. 5, 17). He then enjoyed four months of great ascendancy at Athens, left it at the head of the fleet to Asia
in Oct. 407 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, remained in command of the fleet for about three months or so, then fell into disgrace and retired to Chersonese, never revisiting Athens. In 406 <span
class="smcap">B.C.</span> Alkibiades was again in banishment, out of the reach of all such warnings as Hermann and Steinhart suppose that Plato intended to address to him in Alkib. i.</p>

<p>Steinhart says (p. 152), &ldquo;In dieser Zeit also, <i>wenige Jahre nach seiner triumphirenden R&uuml;ckkehr</i>, wo Alkibiades,&rdquo; &amp;c. Now Alkibiades left the Athenian service,
irrevocably, within less <i>than one year</i> after his triumphant return.</p>

<p>Steinhart has not realised in his mind the historical and chronological conditions of the period.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_29" id="Sidenotev2_12_29"></a> Analogy with various dialogues in the Xenophontic Memorabilia &mdash; Purpose of Sokrates to humble presumptuous young
men.</span></p>

<p>If we compare various colloquies of Sokrates in the Xenophontic Memorabilia, we shall find Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II. very analogous to them both in purpose and spirit. In Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. the
situation conceived is the same as that of Sokrates and Glaukon, in the third book of the Memorabilia. Xenophon recounts how the presumptuous Glaukon, hardly twenty years of age, fancied himself
already fit to play a conspicuous part in public affairs, and tried to force himself, in spite of rebuffs and humiliations, upon the notice of the assembly.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_46" href=
"#Footnotev2_12_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> No remonstrances of friends could deter him, nor could anything, except the ingenious dialectic of Sokrates, convince him of his own impertinent
forwardness and exaggerated self-estimation. Probably Plato (Glaukon&rsquo;s elder brother) had heard of this conversation, but whether the fact be so or not, we see the same situation idealised by
him in Alkibiad&ecirc;s I., and worked out in a way of his own. Again, we find in the Xenophontic Memorabilia another colloquy, wherein Sokrates cross-questions, perplexes, and humiliates, the
studious youth Euthydemus,<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_47" href="#Footnotev2_12_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> whom he regards as over-confident in his persuasions and too well satisfied with himself.
It was among the specialties of Sokrates to humiliate confident young men, with a view to their future improvement. He made his conversation &ldquo;an instrument of chastisement,&rdquo; in the
language of Xenophon: or (to use a phrase of Plato himself in the Lysis) he conceived. &ldquo;that the proper way of talking to youth whom you love, was, not to exalt and puff them up, but to subdue
and humiliate them&rdquo;.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_48" href="#Footnotev2_12_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a></p>

<p>If Plato wished to idealise this feature in the character of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page22" id="v2page22"></a>22</span> Sokrates, no name could be more suitable to his purpose than that
of Alkibiades: who, having possessed as a youth the greatest personal beauty (to which Sokrates was exquisitely sensible) had become in his mature life distinguished not less for unprincipled
ambition and insolence, than for energy and ability. We know the real Alkibiad&ecirc;s both from Thucydides and Xenophon, and we also know that Alkibiades had in his youth so far frequented the
society of Sokrates as to catch some of that dialectic ingenuity, which the latter was expected and believed to impart.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_49" href="#Footnotev2_12_49"><span class=
"sp">49</span></a> The contrast, as well as the companionship, between Sokrates and Alkibiades was eminently suggestive to the writers of Sokratic dialogues, and nearly all of them made use of it,
composing dialogues in which Alkibiades was the principal name and figure.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_50" href="#Footnotev2_12_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> It would be surprising indeed if Plato had
never done the same: which is what we must suppose, if we adopt Schleiermacher&rsquo;s view, that both Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II. are spurious. In the Protagoras as well as in the Symposion,
Alkibiades figures; but in neither of them is he the principal person, or titular hero, of the piece. In Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II., he is introduced as the solitary respondent to the questions of
Sokrates &mdash; &kappa;&omicron;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&rho;&#943;&omicron;&upsilon; &#7957;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha;: to receive from Sokrates a lesson of humiliation such as the
Xenophontic Sokrates administers to Glaukon and Euthydemus, taking care to address the latter when alone.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_51" href="#Footnotev2_12_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a></p>

<p>I conceive Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II. as composed by Plato among his earlier writings (perhaps between 399-390 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>)<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_52" href=
"#Footnotev2_12_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> giving an imaginary picture of the way in which <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page23" id="v2page23"></a>23</span>&ldquo;Sokrates handled every

whom Aristophanes characterises as the lion&rsquo;s whelp.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_54" href="#Footnotev2_12_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> In selecting Alkibiades as the sufferer under such a
chastising process, Plato rebuts in his own ideal style that charge which Xenophon answers with prosaic directness &mdash; the charge made against Sokrates by his enemies, that he taught political
craft without teaching ethical sobriety; and that he had encouraged by his training the lawless propensities of Alkibiades.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_55" href="#Footnotev2_12_55"><span class=
"sp">55</span></a> When Schleiermacher, and others who disallow the dialogue, argue that the inordinate insolence ascribed to Alkibiades, and the submissive deference towards Sokrates also ascribed
to him, are incongruous and incompatible attributes, &mdash; I reply that such a conjunction is very improbable in any real character. But this does not hinder Plato from combining them in one and
the same ideal character, as we shall farther see when we come to the manifestation of Alkibiades in the Symposion: <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page24" id="v2page24"></a>24</span>in which
dialogue we find a combination of the same elements, still more extravagant and high-coloured. Both here and there we are made to see that Sokrates, far from encouraging Alkibiades, is the only
person who ever succeeded in humbling him. Plato attributes to the personality and conversation of Sokrates an influence magical and almost superhuman: which Cicero and Plutarch, proceeding probably
upon the evidence of the Platonic dialogues, describe as if it were historical fact. They represent Alkibiades as shedding tears of sorrow and shame, and entreating Sokrates to rescue him from a
sense of degradation insupportably painful.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_56" href="#Footnotev2_12_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> Now Xenophon mentions Euthydemus and other young men as having really
experienced these profound and distressing emotions.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_57" href="#Footnotev2_12_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> But he does not at all certify the same about Alkibiades, whose
historical career is altogether adverse to the hypothesis. The Platonic picture is an <i>id&eacute;al</i>, drawn from what may have been actually true about other interlocutors of Sokrates, and
calculated to reply to Mel&ecirc;tus and his allies.</p>

found (i. 4, 9). It is plain, therefore, that <i>they</i> did not consider the dialogue to have been composed before the death of Sokrates. I think it very probable that Plato had in his mind
Xenophon (either his Anabasis, or personal communications with him); but at any rate visits of Greeks to the Persian court became very numerous between 399-390 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,
whereas Plato can hardly have seen any such visitors at Athens in 406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (before the close of the war), nor probably in 402 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when Athens,
though relieved from the oligarchy, was still in a state of great public prostration. Between 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and the peace of Antalkidas (387 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>),
visitors from Greece to the interior of Persia became more and more frequent, the Persian kings interfering very actively in Grecian politics. Plato may easily have seen during these years
intelligent Greeks who had been up to the Persian court on military or political business. Both the Persian kings and the Spartan kings were then in the maximum of power and ascendancy &mdash; it is
no wonder therefore that Sokrates should here be made to dwell upon their prodigious dignity in his discourse with Alkibiades. Steinhart (Einl. p. 150) feels the difficulty of reconciling this part
of the dialogue with his hypothesis that it was composed in 406 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>: yet he and Stallbaum both insist that it must have been composed before the death of Sokrates, for
which they really produce no grounds at all.</p>

knowledge.</span></p>

<p>Looking at Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II. in this point of view, we shall find them perfectly Sokratic both in topics proclaimed and in manner &mdash; whatever may be said about unnecessary prolixity
and common-place here and there. The leading ideas of Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. may be found, nearly all, in the Platonic Apology. That warfare, which Sokrates proclaims in the Apology as having been the
mission of his life, against the false persuasion of knowledge, or against beliefs ethical and &aelig;sthetical, firmly entertained without having been preceded by conscious study or subjected to
serious examination &mdash; is exemplified in Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. and II. as emphatically as in any Platonic composition. In both these dialogues, indeed (especially in the first), we find an
excessive repetition of specialising illustrations, often needless and sometimes tiresome: a defect easily intelligible if we assume them to have been written when Plato was still a novice in the art
of dialogic composition. But both dialogues are fully impregnated with the spirit of the Sokratic process, exposing, though with exuberant prolixity, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page25" id=
"v2page25"></a>25</span>firm and universal belief, held and affirmed by every one even at the age of boyhood, without any assignable grounds or modes of acquisition, and amidst angry discordance
between the affirmation of one man and another. The emphasis too with which Sokrates insists upon his own single function of merely questioning, and upon the fact that Alkibiades gives all the
answers and pronounces all the self-condemnation with his own mouth<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_58" href="#Footnotev2_12_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> &mdash; is remarkable in this dialogue: as well
as the confidence with which he proclaims the dialogue as affording the only, but effective, cure.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_59" href="#Footnotev2_12_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> The ignorance of
which Alkibiades stands unexpectedly convicted, is expressly declared to be common to him with the other Athenian politicians: an exception being half allowed to pass in favour of the
semi-philosophical Perikles, whom Plato judges here with less severity than elsewhere<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_60" href="#Footnotev2_12_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> &mdash; and a decided
superiority being claimed for the Spartan and Persian kings, who are extolled as systematically trained from childhood.</p>

<p>The main purpose of Sokrates is to drive Alkibiades into self-contradictions, and to force upon him a painful consciousness of ignorance and mental defect, upon grave and important subjects, while
he is yet young enough to amend it. Towards this purpose he is made to lay claim to a divine mission similar to that which the real Sokrates announces in the Apology<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_61" href=
"#Footnotev2_12_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> A number of perplexing questions and difficulties are accumulated: it is not meant that these difficulties are insoluble, but that they cannot be
solved by one who has never seriously reflected on them &mdash; by one who (as the Xenophontic Sokrates says to Euthydemus),<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_62" href="#Footnotev2_12_62"><span class=
"sp">62</span></a> is so confident of knowing the subject that he has never meditated upon it at all. The disheartened Alkibiades feels the necessity of improving himself and supplicates the
assistance of Sokrates:<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_63" href="#Footnotev2_12_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> who reminds him that he must first determine what &ldquo;Himself&rdquo; is. Here again we
find ourselves upon the track of Sokrates in the Platonic Apology, and under the influence of the memorable inscription at Delphi &mdash; <i>Nosce teipsum</i>. Your mind is yourself; your body is a
mere instrument of your <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page26" id="v2page26"></a>26</span>mind: your wealth and power are simple appurtenances or adjuncts. To know yourself, which is genuine
Sophrosyn&ecirc; or temperance, is to know your mind: but this can only be done by looking into another mind, and into its most intelligent compartment: just as the eye can only see itself by looking
into the centre of vision of another eye.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_64" href="#Footnotev2_12_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_34" id="Sidenotev2_12_34"></a> Sokrates furnishes no means of solving these difficulties. He exhorts to Justice and Virtue &mdash; but these are
acknowledged Incognita.</span></p>

<p>At the same time, when, after having convicted Alkibiades of deplorable ignorance, Sokrates is called upon to prescribe remedies &mdash; all distinctness of indication disappears. It is exacted
only when the purpose is to bring difficulties and contradictions to view: it is dispensed with, when the purpose is to solve them. The conclusion is, that assuming happiness as the acknowledged
ultimate end,<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_65" href="#Footnotev2_12_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> Alkibiades cannot secure this either for himself or for his city, by striving for wealth and power,
private or public: he can only secure it by acquiring for himself, and implanting in his country-men, justice, temperance, and virtue. This is perfectly Sokratic, and conformable to what is said by
the real Sokrates in the Platonic Apology. But coming at the close of Alkibiad&ecirc;s I., it presents no meaning and imparts no instruction: because Sokrates had shown in the earlier part of the
dialogue, that neither he himself, nor Alkibiades, nor the general public, knew what justice and virtue were. The positive solution which Sokrates professes to give, is therefore illusory. He throws
us back upon those old, familiar, emotional, associations, unconscious products and unexamined transmissions from mind to mind &mdash; which he had already shown to represent the fancy of knowledge
without the reality &mdash; deep-seated belief without any assignable intellectual basis, or outward standard of rectitude.</p>

explained.</span></p>

<p>Throughout the various Platonic dialogues, we find alternately two distinct and opposite methods of handling &mdash; the generalising of the special, and the specialising of the general. In
Alkibiad&ecirc;s I, the specialising of the general preponderates &mdash; as it does in most of the conversations of the Xenophontic Memorabilia: the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page27" id=
"v2page27"></a>27</span>number of exemplifying particulars is unusually great. Sokrates does not accept as an answer a general term, without illustrating it by several of the specific terms
comprehended under it: and this several times on occasions when an instructed reader thinks it superfluous and tiresome: hence, partly, the inclination of some modern critics to disallow the
dialogue. But we must recollect that though a modern reader practised in the use of general terms may seize the meaning at once, an Athenian youth of the Platonic age would not be sure of doing the
same. No conscious analysis had yet been applied to general terms: no grammar or logic then entered into education. Confident affirmation, without fully knowing the meaning of what is affirmed, is
the besetting sin against which Plato here makes war: and his precautions for exposing it are pushed to extreme minuteness. So, too, in the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus, when he wishes to illustrate
the process of logical division and subdivision, he applies it to cases so trifling and so multiplied, that Socher is revolted and rejects the dialogues altogether. But Plato himself foresees and
replies to the objection; declaring expressly that his main purpose is, not to expound the particular subject chosen, but to make manifest and familiar the steps and conditions of the general
classifying process &mdash; and that prolixity cannot be avoided.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_66" href="#Footnotev2_12_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> We must reckon upon a similar purpose in
Alkibiad&ecirc;s I. The dialogue is a specimen of that which Aristotle calls Inductive Dialectic, as distinguished from Syllogistic: the Inductive he considers to be plainer and easier, suitable when
you have an ordinary collocutor &mdash; the Syllogistic is the more cogent, when you are dealing with a practised disputant.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_67" href="#Footnotev2_12_67"><span class=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_36" id="Sidenotev2_12_36"></a> Alkibiad&ecirc;s II. leaves its problem avowedly undetermined.</span></p>

<p>It has been seen that Alkibiad&ecirc;s I, though professing to give something like a solution, gives what is really no solution at all. Alkibiad&ecirc;s II., similar in many respects, is here
different, inasmuch as it does not even profess to solve the difficulty which had been raised. The general mental defect &mdash; false persuasion of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page28"
id="v2page28"></a>28</span> without the reality &mdash; is presented in its application to a particular case. Alkibiades is obliged to admit that he does not know what he ought to pray to the Gods
for: neither what is <i>good</i>, to be granted, nor what is <i>evil</i>, to be averted. He relies upon Sokrates for dispelling this mist from his mind: which Sokrates promises to do, but adjourns
for another occasion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_37" id="Sidenotev2_12_37"></a> Sokrates commends the practice of praying to the Gods for favours undefined &mdash; his views about the semi-regular,
semi-irregular agency of the Gods &mdash; he prays to them for premonitory warnings.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates here ascribes to the Spartans, and to various philosophers, the practice of putting up prayers in undefined language, for good and honourable things generally. He commends that practice.
Xenophon tells us that the historical Sokrates observed it:<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_68" href="#Footnotev2_12_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> but he tells us also that the historical Sokrates, though
not praying for any special presents from the Gods, yet prayed for and believed himself to receive special irregular revelations and advice as to what was good to be done or avoided in particular
cases. He held that these special revelations were essential to any tolerable life: that the dispensations of the Gods, though administered upon regular principles on certain subjects and up to a
certain point, were kept by them designedly inscrutable beyond that point: but that the Gods would, if properly solicited, afford premonitory warnings to any favoured person, such as would enable him
to keep out of the way of evil, and put himself in the way of good. He declared that to consult and obey oracles and prophets was not less a maxim of prudence than a duty of piety: for himself, he
was farther privileged through his divine sign or monitor, which he implicitly followed.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_69" href="#Footnotev2_12_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> Such premonitory warnings
were the only special favour which he thought it suitable to pray for &mdash; besides good things generally. For special presents he did not pray, because he professed not to know whether any of the
ordinary objects of desire were good or bad. He proves in his conversation with Euthyd&ecirc;mus, that all those acquisitions which are usually accounted means of happiness &mdash; beauty, strength,
wealth, reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page29" id="v2page29"></a>29</span> nay, even good health and wisdom &mdash; are sometimes good or causes of happiness, sometimes evil or causes of
misery; and therefore cannot be considered either as absolutely the one or absolutely the other.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_70" href="#Footnotev2_12_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a></p>

<p>This impossibility of determining what is good and what is evil, in consequence of the uncertainty in the dispensations of the Gods and in human affairs &mdash; is a doctrine forcibly insisted on
by the Xenophontic Sokrates in his discourse with Euthyd&ecirc;mus, and much akin to the Platonic Alkibiad&ecirc;s II., being applied to the special case of prayer. But we must not suppose that
Sokrates adheres to this doctrine throughout all the colloquies of the Xenophontic Memorabilia: on the contrary, we find him, in other places, reasoning upon such matters, as health, strength, and
wisdom, as if they were decidedly good.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_71" href="#Footnotev2_12_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> The fact is, that the arguments of Sokrates, in the Xenophontic Memorabilia,
vary materially according to the occasion and the person with whom he is discoursing: and the case is similar with the Platonic dialogues: illustrating farther the questionable evidence on which
Schleiermacher and other critics proceed, when they declare one dialogue to be spurious, because it contains reasoning inconsistent with another.</p>

<p>We find in Alkibiad&ecirc;s II. another doctrine which is also proclaimed by Sokrates in the Xenophontic Memorabilia: that the Gods are not moved by costly sacrifice more than by humble sacrifice,
according to the circumstances of the offerer:<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_72" href="#Footnotev2_12_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a> they attend only to the mind of the offerer, whether he be just and

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_39" id="Sidenotev2_12_39"></a> Remarkable doctrine of Alkibiad&ecirc;s II. &mdash; that knowledge is not always Good. The knowledge of Good itself is
indispensable: without that, the knowledge of other things is more hurtful than beneficial.</span></p>

<p>But we find also in Alkibiad&ecirc;s II. another doctrine, more remarkable. Sokrates will not proclaim absolutely that knowledge is good, and that ignorance is evil. In some cases, he contends,
ignorance is good; and he discriminates which the cases are. That which we <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page30" id="v2page30"></a>30</span> are principally interested in knowing, is <i>Good</i>,
or The <i>Best</i> &mdash; The <i>Profitable</i>:<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_74" href="#Footnotev2_12_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> phrases used as equivalent. The knowledge of this is good, and the
ignorance of it mischievous, under all supposable circumstances. And if a man knows good, the more he knows of everything else, the better; since he will sure to make a good use of his knowledge. But
if he does not know good, the knowledge of other things will be hurtful rather than beneficial to him. To be skilful in particular arts and accomplishments, under the capital mental deficiency
supposed, will render him an instrument of evil and not of good. The more he knows &mdash; and the more he believes himself to know &mdash; the more forward will he be in acting, and therefore the
greater amount of harm will he do. It is better that he should act as little as possible. Such a man is not fit to direct his own conduct, like a freeman: he must be directed and controlled by
others, like a slave. The greater number of mankind are fools of this description &mdash; ignorant of good: the wise men who know good, and are fit to direct, are very few. The wise man alone,
knowing good, follows reason: the rest trust to opinion, without reason.<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_75" href="#Footnotev2_12_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> He alone is competent to direct both his own

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_12_40" id="Sidenotev2_12_40"></a> Knowledge of Good &mdash; appears postulated and divined, in many of the Platonic dialogues, under different
titles.</span></p>

<p>What Plato here calls the knowledge of Good, or Reason &mdash; the just discrimination and comparative appreciation of Ends and Means &mdash; appears in the Politikus and Euthyd&ecirc;mus, under
the title of the Regal or Political Art, of employing or directing<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_77" href="#Footnotev2_12_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> the results of all other arts, which are
considered as subordinate: in the Protagoras, under the title of art of calculation or mensuration: in the Phil&ecirc;bus, as measure and proportion: in the Ph&aelig;drus (in regard to rhetoric) as
the art of turning to account, for the main purpose of persuasion, all the special processes, stratagems, decorations, &amp;c., imparted by professional masters. In the Republic, it is personified in
the few venerable Elders who constitute the Reason of the society, and whose directions all the rest (Guardians and Producers) are bound implicitly to follow: the virtue of the subordinates
consisting in this implicit obedience. In the Leges, it is defined as the complete subjection in the mind, of pleasures and pains to right Reason,<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_78" href=
"#Footnotev2_12_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> without which, no special aptitudes are worth having. In the Xenophontic Memorabilia, it stands as a Sokratic authority under the title of
Sophrosyn&ecirc; or Temperance:<a name="FnAnchorv2_12_79" href="#Footnotev2_12_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> and the Profitable is declared identical with the Good, as the directing and limiting

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_1" id="Sidenotev2_13_1"></a> Hippias Major &mdash; situation supposed &mdash; character of the dialogue. Sarcasm and mockery against
Hippias.</span></p>

<p>Both these two dialogues are carried on between Sokrates and the Eleian Sophist Hippias. The general conception of Hippias &mdash; described as accomplished, eloquent, and successful, yet made to
say vain and silly things &mdash; is the same in both dialogues: in both also the polemics of Sokrates against him are conducted in a like spirit, of affected deference mingled with insulting
sarcasm. Indeed the figure assigned to Hippias is so contemptible, that even an admiring critic like Stallbaum cannot avoid noticing the &ldquo;petulans pene et proterva in Hippiam oratio,&rdquo; and
intimating that Plato has handled Hippias more coarsely than any one else. Such petulance Stallbaum attempts to excuse by saying that the dialogue is a youthful composition of Plato:<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_13_1" href="#Footnotev2_13_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> while Schleiermacher numbers it among the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page34" id="v2page34"></a>34</span>reasons for
suspecting the dialogue, and Ast, among the reasons for declaring positively that Plato is not the author.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_2" href="#Footnotev2_13_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> This last
conclusion I do not at all accept: nor even the hypothesis of Stallbaum, if it be tendered as an excuse for improprieties of tone: for I believe that the earliest of Plato&rsquo;s dialogues was
composed after he was twenty-eight years of age &mdash; that is, after the death of Sokrates. It is however noway improbable, that both the Greater and Lesser Hippias may have been among
Plato&rsquo;s earlier compositions. We see by the Memorabilia of Xenophon that there was repeated and acrimonious controversy between Sokrates and Hippias: so that we may probably suppose feelings of
special dislike, determining Plato to compose two distinct dialogues, in which an imaginary Hippias is mocked and scourged by an imaginary Sokrates.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_13_1" id="Footnotev2_13_1"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_13_1">1</a></span> Stallbaum, Prolegg. in Hipp. Maj. p. 149-150; also Steinhart (Einleitung,
p. 42-43), who says, after an outpouring of his usual invective against the Sophist: &ldquo;Nevertheless the coarse jesting of the dialogue seems almost to exceed the admissible limit of comic
effect,&rdquo; &amp;c. Again, p. 50, Steinhart talks of the banter which Sokrates carries on with Hippias, in a way not less cruel (grausam) than purposeless, tormenting him with a string of
successive new propositions about the definition of the Beautiful, which propositions, as fast as Hippias catches at them, he again withdraws of his own accord, and thus at last dismisses him (as he
had dismissed Ion) uninstructed and unimproved, without even leaving behind in him the sting of anger, &amp;c.</p>

<p>It requires a powerful hatred against the persons called Sophists, to make a critic take pleasure in a comedy wherein silly and ridiculous speeches are fastened upon the name of one of them, in
his own day not merely honoured but acknowledged as deserving honour by remarkable and varied accomplishments &mdash; and to make the critic describe the historical Hippias (whom we only know from
Plato and Xenophon &mdash; see Steinhart, note 7, p. 89; Socher, p. 221) as if he had really delivered these speeches, or something equally absurd.</p>

<p>How this comedy may be appreciated is doubtless a matter of individual taste. For my part, I agree with Ast in thinking it misplaced and unbecoming: and I am not surprised that he wishes to remove
the dialogue from the Platonic canon, though I do not concur either in this inference, or in the general principle on which it proceeds, viz., that all objections against the composition of a
dialogue are to be held as being also objections against its genuineness as a work of Plato. The Nubes of Aristophanes, greatly superior as a comedy to the Hippias of Plato, is turned to an abusive
purpose when critics put it into court as evidence about the character of the real Sokrates.</p>

<p>K. F. Hermann, in my judgment, takes a more rational view of the Hippias Major (Gesch. und Syst. der Plat. Phil. p. 487-647). Instead of expatiating on the glory of Plato in deriding an
accomplished contemporary, he dwells upon the logical mistakes and confusion which the dialogue brings to view; and he reminds us justly of the intellectual condition of the age, when even elementary
distinctions in logic and grammar had been scarcely attended to.</p>

<p>Both K. F. Hermann and Socher consider the Hippias to be not a juvenile production of Plato, but to belong to his middle age.</p>

debate.</span></p>

<p>One considerable point in the Hippias Major appears to have a bearing on the debate between Sokrates and Hippias in the Xenophontic Memorabilia: in which debate, Hippias taunts Sokrates with
always combating and deriding the opinions of others, while evading to give opinions of his own. It appears that some antecedent debates between the two had turned upon the definition of the Just,
and that on these occasions Hippias had been the respondent, Sokrates the objector. Hippias professes to have reflected upon these debates, and to be now prepared with a definition which neither
Sokrates nor any one else can successfully assail, but he will not say what the definition is, until Sokrates has laid down one of his own. In reply to this challenge, Sokrates declares the Just to
be equivalent to the Lawful or Customary: he defends this against various <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page35" id="v2page35"></a>35</span>objections of Hippias, who concludes by admitting it.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_13_3" href="#Footnotev2_13_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Probably this debate, as reported by Xenophon, or something very like it, really took place. If so, we remark with
surprise the feebleness of the objections of Hippias, in a case where Sokrates, if he had been the objector, would have found such strong ones &mdash; and the feeble replies given by Sokrates, whose
talent lay in starting and enforcing difficulties, not in solving them.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_4" href="#Footnotev2_13_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Among the remarks which Sokrates makes in
illustration to Hippias, one is &mdash; that Lykurgus had ensured superiority to Sparta by creating in the Spartans a habit of implicit obedience to the laws.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_5" href=

renown as well as the gain acquired by his lectures.</span></p>

<p>Here, in the beginning of the Hippias Major, the Platonic Sokrates remarks that Hippias has been long absent from Athens: which absence, the latter explains, by saying that he has visited many
cities in Greece, giving lectures with great success, and receiving high pay: and that especially he has often visited Sparta, partly to give lectures, but partly also to transact diplomatic business
for his countrymen the Eleians, who trusted him more than any one else for such duties. His lectures (he says) were eminently instructive and valuable for the training of youth: moreover they were so
generally approved, that even from a small Sicilian town called Inykus, he obtained a considerable sum in fees.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_4" id="Sidenotev2_13_4"></a> Hippias had met with no success at Sparta. Why the Spartans did not admit his instructions &mdash; their law
forbids.</span></p>

<p>Upon this Sokrates asks &mdash; In which of the cities were your gains the largest: probably at Sparta? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; No; I received nothing at all at Sparta. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How? You
amaze me! Were not your lectures calculated to improve the Spartan youth? or did not the Spartans desire to have their youth improved? or had they no money? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; Neither one nor the
other. The Spartans, like others, desire the improvement of their youth: they also have plenty of money: moreover <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page36" id="v2page36"></a>36</span>my lectures were
very beneficial to them as well as to the rest.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_6" href="#Footnotev2_13_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How could it happen then, that at Sparta, a city
great and eminent for its good laws, your valuable instructions were left unrewarded; while you received so much at the inconsiderable town of Inykus? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; It is not the custom of the
country, Sokrates, for the Spartans to change their laws, or to educate their sons in a way different from their ordinary routine. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How say you? It is not the custom of the
country for the Spartans to do right, but to do wrong? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; I shall not say that, Sokrates. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But surely they would do right, in educating their children better and
not worse? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; Yes, they would do right: but it is not lawful for them to admit a foreign mode of education. If any one could have obtained payment there for education, I should have
obtained a great deal; for they listen to me with delight and applaud me: but, as I told you, their law forbids.</p>

your scheme, foreign as it is, than according to their own native scheme. <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; I affirm it, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page37" id="v2page37"></a>37</span>and with truth too. <i>
Sokr.</i> &mdash; You affirm besides, that things more profitable are at the same time more lawful? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; I said so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; According to your reasoning, then, it is more
lawful for the Spartan children to be educated by Hippias, and more unlawful for them to be educated by their fathers &mdash; if in reality they will be more benefited by you? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; But
they will be more benefited by me. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The Spartans therefore act unlawfully, when they refuse to give you money and to confide to you their sons? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; I admit that
they do: indeed your reasoning seems to make in my favour, so that I am noway called upon to resist it. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; We find then, after all, that the Spartans are enemies of law, and that
too in the most important matters &mdash; though they are esteemed the most exemplary followers of law.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_8" href="#Footnotev2_13_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_6" id="Sidenotev2_13_6"></a> Comparison of the argument of the Platonic Sokrates with that of the Xenophontic Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps Plato intended the above argument as a derisory taunt against the Sophist Hippias, for being vain enough to think his own tuition better than that of the Spartan community. If such was his
intention, the argument might have been retorted against Plato himself, for his propositions in the Republic and Leges: and we know that the enemies of Plato did taunt him with his inability to get
these schemes adopted in any actual community. But the argument becomes interesting when we compare it with the debate before referred to in the Xenophontic Memorabilia, where Sokrates maintains
against Hippias that the Just is equivalent to the Lawful. In that Xenophontic dialogue, all the difficulties which embarrass this explanation are kept out of sight, and Sokrates is represented as
gaining an easy victory over Hippias. In this Platonic dialogue, the equivocal use of the word &nu;&#972;&mu;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu; is expressly adverted to, and Sokrates reduces Hippias to a
supposed absurdity, by making him pronounce the Spartans to be enemies of law: &pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&#973;&sigmaf; bearing a double sense, and the proposition being true
in one sense, false in the other. In the argument of the Platonic Sokrates, a law which does not attain its intended purpose of benefiting the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page38" id="v2page38">
</a>38</span>community, is no law at all, &mdash; not lawful:<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_9" href="#Footnotev2_13_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> so that we are driven back again upon the objections of
Alkibiades against Perikles (in the Xenophontic Memorabilia) in regard to what constitutes a law. In the argument of the Xenophontic Sokrates, law means a law actually established, by official
authority or custom &mdash; and the Spartans are produced as eminent examples of a lawfully minded community. As far as we can assign positive opinion to the Platonic Sokrates in the Hippias Major,
he declares that the profitable or useful (being that which men always aim at in making law) is The Lawful, whether actually established or not: and that the unprofitable or hurtful (being that which
men always intend to escape) is The Unlawful, whether prescribed by any living authority or not. This (he says) is the opinion of the wise men who know: though the ignorant vulgar hold the contrary
opinion. The explanation of &tau;&#8056; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; given by the Xenophontic Sokrates (&tau;&#8056; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; = &tau;&#8056;
&nu;&#972;&mu;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;), would be equivalent, if we construe &tau;&#8056; &nu;&#972;&mu;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu; in the sense of the Platonic Sokrates (in Hippias Major) as an
affirmation that The Just was the generally useful &mdash; &Tau;&#8056; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; = &tau;&#8056; &kappa;&omicron;&iota;&nu;&#8135;
&sigma;&#973;&mu;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&nu;.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_7" id="Sidenotev2_13_7"></a> The Just or Good is the beneficial or profitable. This is the only explanation which Plato ever gives and to this he does
not always adhere.</span></p>

<p>There exists however in all this, a prevalent confusion between Law (or the Lawful) as actually established, and Law (or the Lawful) as it ought to be established, in the judgment of the critic,
or of those whom he follows: that is (to use the phrase of Mr. Austin in his &lsquo;Province of Jurisprudence&rsquo;) Law as it would be, if it conformed to its assumed measure or test. In the first
of these senses, &tau;&#8056; &nu;&#972;&mu;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu; is not one and the same, but variable according to place and time &mdash; one thing at Sparta, another thing elsewhere: accordingly
it would not satisfy the demand of Plato&rsquo;s mind, when he asks for an explanation of &tau;&#8056; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu;. It is an explanation in the second of the two
senses which Plato seeks &mdash; a common measure or test applicable universally, at all times and places. In so far as he ever finds one, it is that which I have mentioned above as delivered by the
Platonic Sokrates in this dialogue: viz., the Just or Good, that which ought to be the measure or test of Law and Positive <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page39" id="v2page39">
</a>39</span>Morality, is, the beneficial or profitable. This (I repeat) is the only approach to a solution which we ever find in Plato. But this is seldom clearly enunciated, never systematically
followed out, and sometimes, in appearance, even denied.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_8" id="Sidenotev2_13_8"></a> Lectures of Hippias at Sparta not upon geometry, or astronomy, &amp;c., but upon the question &mdash; What pursuits are
beautiful, fine, and honourable for youth.</span></p>

<p>I resume the thread of the Hippias Major. Sokrates asks Hippias what sort of lectures they were that he delivered with so much success at Sparta? The Spartans (Hippias replies) knew nothing and
cared nothing about letters, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy: but they took delight in hearing tales about heroes, early ancestors, foundation-legends of cities, &amp;c., which his mnemonic artifice
enabled him to deliver.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_10" href="#Footnotev2_13_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> The Spartans delight in you (observes Sokrates) as children delight in old women&rsquo;s
tales. Yes (replies Hippias), but that is not all: I discoursed to them also, recently, about fine and honourable pursuits, much to their admiration: I supposed a conversation between Nestor and
Neoptolemus, after the capture of Troy, in which the veteran, answering a question put by his youthful companion, enlarged upon those pursuits which it was fine, honourable, beautiful for a young man
to engage in. My discourse is excellent, and obtained from the Spartans great applause. I am going to deliver it again here at Athens, in the school-room of Pheidostratus, and I invite you, Sokrates,
to come and hear it, with as many friends as you can bring.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_11" href="#Footnotev2_13_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_9" id="Sidenotev2_13_9"></a> Question put by Sokrates, in the name of a friend in the background, who has just been puzzling him with it &mdash; What
is the Beautiful?</span></p>

<p>I shall come willingly (replied Sokrates). But first answer me one small question, which will rescue me from a present embarrassment. Just now, I was shamefully puzzled in conversation with a
friend, to whom I had been praising some things as honourable and beautiful, &mdash; blaming other things as mean and ugly. He surprised me by the interrogation &mdash; How do you know, Sokrates,
what things are beautiful, and what are ugly? Come now, can you tell me, What is the Beautiful? I, in my stupidity, was altogether puzzled, and could not answer the question. But after I had parted
from <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page40" id="v2page40"></a>40</span>him, I became mortified and angry with myself; and I vowed that the next time I met any wise man, like you, I would put the
question to him, and learn how to answer it; so that I might be able to renew the conversation with my friend. Your coming here is most opportune. I entreat you to answer and explain to me clearly
what the Beautiful is; in order that I may not again incur the like mortification. You can easily answer: it is a small matter for you, with your numerous attainments.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_10" id="Sidenotev2_13_10"></a> Hippias thinks the question easy to answer.</span></p>

<p>Oh &mdash; yes &mdash; a small matter (replies Hippias); the question is easy to answer. I could teach you to answer many questions harder than that: so that no man shall be able to convict you in
dialogue.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_12" href="#Footnotev2_13_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>Sokrates then proceeds to interrogate Hippias, in the name of the absentee, starting one difficulty after another as if suggested by this unknown prompter, and pretending to be himself under awe
of so impracticable a disputant.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_11" id="Sidenotev2_13_11"></a> Justice, Wisdom, Beauty must each be something. What is Beauty, or the Beautiful?</span></p>

<p>All persons are just, through Justice &mdash; wise, through Wisdom &mdash; good, through Goodness or the Good &mdash; beautiful, through Beauty or the Beautiful. Now Justice, Wisdom, Goodness,
Beauty or the Beautiful, must each be <i>something</i>. Tell me what the Beautiful is?</p>

see the difference. I answer that a beautiful maiden is a beautiful thing. No one can deny that.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_13" href="#Footnotev2_13_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a></p>

</div>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; My disputatious friend will not accept your answer. He wants you to tell him, What is the Self-Beautiful? &mdash; that Something through which all beautiful things become
beautiful. Am I to tell him, it is because a beautiful maiden is a beautiful thing? He will say &mdash; Is not a beautiful mare a beautiful thing also? and a beautiful lyre as well? <i>Hip.</i>
&mdash; Yes; &mdash; both of them are so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Ay, and a beautiful pot, my friend will add, well moulded and rounded by a skilful potter, is a beautiful thing too. <i>Hip.</i> &mdash;
How, Sokrates? Who can your <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page41" id="v2page41"></a>41</span>disputatious friend be? Some ill-taught man, surely; since he introduces such trivial names into a
dignified debate. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Yes; that is his character: not polite, but vulgar, anxious for nothing else but the truth. <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; A pot, if it be beautifully made, must certainly
be called beautiful; yet still, all such objects are unworthy to be counted as beautiful, if compared with a maiden, a mare, or a lyre.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_13" id="Sidenotev2_13_13"></a> Cross-questioning by Sokrates &mdash; Other things also are beautiful; but each thing is beautiful only by comparison,
or under some particular circumstances &mdash; it is sometimes beautiful, sometimes not beautiful.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; I understand. You follow the analogy suggested by Herakleitus in his dictum &mdash; That the most beautiful ape is ugly, if compared with the human race. So you say, the most
beautiful pot is ugly, when compared with the race of maidens. <i>Hip</i> &mdash; Yes. That is my meaning. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then my friend will ask you in return, whether the race of maidens is
not as much inferior to the race of Gods, as the pot to the maiden? whether the most beautiful maiden will not appear ugly, when compared to a Goddess? whether the wisest of men will not appear an
ape, when compared to the Gods, either in beauty or in wisdom.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_14" href="#Footnotev2_13_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; No one can dispute it. <i>
Sokr.</i> &mdash; My friend will smile and say &mdash; You forget what was the question put. I asked you, What is the Beautiful? &mdash; the Self-Beautiful: and your answer gives me, as the
Self-Beautiful, something which you yourself acknowledge to be no more beautiful than ugly? If I had asked you, from the first, what it was that was both beautiful and ugly, your answer would have
been pertinent to the question. Can you still think that the Self-Beautiful, &mdash; that Something, by the presence of which all other things become beautiful, &mdash; is a maiden, or a mare, or a
lyre?</p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> &mdash; I have another answer to which your friend can take no exception. That, by the presence of which all things become beautiful, is Gold. What was before ugly, will (we all know),
when ornamented with gold, appear beautiful. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You little know what sort of man my friend is. He will laugh at your answer, and ask you &mdash; Do you think, then, that Pheidias
did not know his profession as a sculptor? How came <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page42" id="v2page42"></a>42</span>he not to make the statue of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; all gold, instead of making (as
he has done) the face, hands, and feet of ivory, and the pupils of the eyes of a particular stone? Is not ivory also beautiful, and particular kinds of stone? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; Yes, each is
beautiful, where it is becoming. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; And ugly, where it is not becoming.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_15" href="#Footnotev2_13_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> <i>Hip.</i> &mdash;
Doubtless. I admit that what is becoming or suitable, makes that to which it is applied appear beautiful: that which is not becoming or suitable, makes it appear ugly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; My friend
will next ask you, when you are boiling the beautiful pot of which we spoke just now, full of beautiful soup, what sort of ladle will be suitable and becoming &mdash; one made of gold, or of fig-tree
wood? Will not the golden ladle spoil the soup, and the wooden ladle turn it out good? Is not the wooden ladle, therefore, better than the golden? <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; By H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s,
Sokrates! what a coarse and stupid fellow your friend is! I cannot continue to converse with a man who talks of such matters. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; I am not surprised that you, with your fine attire
and lofty reputation, are offended with these low allusions. But I have nothing to spoil by intercourse with this man; and I entreat you to persevere, as a favour to me. He will ask you whether a
wooden soup-ladle is not more beautiful than a ladle of gold, &mdash; since it is more suitable and becoming? So that though you said &mdash; The Self-Beautiful is Gold &mdash; you are now obliged to
acknowledge that gold is not more beautiful than fig-tree wood?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_15" id="Sidenotev2_13_15"></a> Third answer of Hippias &mdash; questions upon it &mdash; proof given that it fails of universal
application.</span></p>

<p><i>Hip.</i> &mdash; I acknowledge that it is so. But I have another answer ready which will silence your friend. I presume you wish me to indicate as The Beautiful, something which will never
appear ugly to any one, at any time, or at any place.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_16" href="#Footnotev2_13_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; That is exactly what I desire. <i>Hip.</i>
&mdash; Well, I affirm, then, that to every man, always, and everywhere, the following is most beautiful. A man being healthy, rich, honoured by the Greeks, having come to old age and buried his own
parents well, to be himself buried by his own sons well and magnificently. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Your answer sounds imposing; but my friend will laugh it to scorn, and will remind me again, that his
question pointed to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page43" id="v2page43"></a>43</span>Beautiful <i>itself</i><a name="FnAnchorv2_13_17" href="#Footnotev2_13_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a>
&mdash; something which, being present as attribute in any subject, will make that subject (whether stone, wood, man, God, action, study, &amp;c.) beautiful. Now that which you have asserted to be
beautiful to every one everywhere, was not beautiful to Achilles, who accepted by preference the lot of dying before his father &mdash; nor is it so to the heroes, or to the sons of Gods, who do not
survive or bury their fathers. To some, therefore, what you specify is beautiful &mdash; to others it is not beautiful but ugly: that is, it is both beautiful and ugly, like the maiden, the lyre, the
pot, on which we have already remarked. <i>Hip.</i> &mdash; I did not speak about the Gods or Heroes. Your friend is intolerable, for touching on such profanities.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_18" href=
"#Footnotev2_13_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; However, you cannot deny that what you have indicated is beautiful only for the sons of men, and not for the sons of Gods. My
friend will thus make good his reproach against your answer. He will tell me, that all the answers, which we have as yet given, are too absurd. And he may perhaps at the same time himself suggest
another, as he sometimes does in pity for my embarrassment.</p>

it is rejected.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates then mentions, as coming from hints of the absent friend, three or four different explanations of the Self-Beautiful: each of which, when first introduced, he approves, and Hippias
approves also: but each of which he proceeds successively to test and condemn. It is to be remarked that all of them are general explanations: not consisting in conspicuous particular instances, like
those which had come from Hippias. His explanations are the following: &mdash;</p>

<p>1. The suitable or becoming (which had before been glanced at). It is the suitable or becoming which constitutes the Beautiful.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_19" href="#Footnotev2_13_19"><span class=

</div>

<p>To this Sokrates objects: The suitable, or becoming, is what causes objects to <i>appear</i> beautiful &mdash; not what causes them to <i>be really</i> beautiful. Now the latter is that which we
are seeking. The two conditions do not always go together. Those objects, institutions, and pursuits which <i>are really</i> beautiful (fine, honourable) very often do not appear so, either to
individuals or to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page44" id="v2page44"></a>44</span>cities collectively; so that there is perpetual dispute and fighting on the subject. The suitable or becoming,
therefore, as it is certainly what makes objects appear beautiful, so it cannot be what makes them really beautiful.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_20" href="#Footnotev2_13_20"><span class=

<p>2. The useful or profitable. &mdash; We call objects beautiful, looking to the purpose which they are calculated or intended to serve: the human body, with a view to running, wrestling, and other
exercises &mdash; a horse, an ox, a cock, looking to the service required from them &mdash; implements, vehicles on land and ships at sea, instruments for music and other arts all upon the same
principle, looking to the end which they accomplish or help to accomplish. Laws and pursuits are characterised in the same way. In each of these, we give the name Beautiful to the useful, in so far
as it is useful, when it is useful, and for the purpose to which it is useful. To that which is useless or hurtful, in the same manner, we give the name Ugly.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_21" href=

<p>Now that which is capable of accomplishing each end, is useful for such end: that which is incapable, is useless. It is therefore capacity, or power, which is beautiful: incapacity, or impotence,

<p>Most certainly (replies Hippias): this is especially true in our cities and communities, wherein political power is the finest thing possible, political impotence, the meanest.</p>

<p>Yet, on closer inspection (continues Sokrates), such a theory will not hold. Power is employed by all men, though unwillingly, for bad purposes: and each man, through such employment of his power,
does much more harm than good, beginning with his childhood. Now power, which is useful for the doing of evil, can never be called beautiful.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_23" href="#Footnotev2_13_23"><span

<p>You cannot therefore say that Power, taken absolutely, is beautiful. You must add the qualification &mdash; Power used for the production of some good, is beautiful. This, then, would be the
profitable &mdash; the cause or generator of good.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_24" href="#Footnotev2_13_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> But the cause is different from its effect: the generator or
father is different <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page45" id="v2page45"></a>45</span>from the generated or son. The beautiful would, upon this view, be the cause of the good. But then the
beautiful would be different from the good, and the good different from the beautiful? Who can admit this? It is obviously wrong: it is the most ridiculous theory which we have yet hit upon.<a name=

them beautiful: especially the pleasures of sex, which as pleasures are the greatest of all, but which are ugly and disgraceful to behold. He will answer &mdash; I understand you: you are ashamed to
call these pleasures beautiful, because they do not seem so to the multitude: but I did not ask you, what <i>seems</i> beautiful to the multitude &mdash; I asked you, what <i>is</i> beautiful.<a

<p>These last words deserve attention, because they coincide with the doctrine ascribed to Antisthenes, which has caused so many hard words to be applied to him (as well as to Stilpon) by critics,
from Kol&ocirc;tes downwards. The general principle here laid down by Plato is &mdash; A is something different from B, therefore A is not B and B is not A. In other words, A cannot be predicated of
B nor B of A. Antisthenes said in like manner &mdash; &#7948;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; and &#7944;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#8056;&sigmaf; are different from each other, therefore you
cannot say &#7948;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#7952;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&nu; &#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#972;&sigmaf;. You can only say

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_22" id="Sidenotev2_13_22"></a> Remarks upon the Dialogue &mdash; the explanations ascribed to Hippias are special conspicuous examples: those ascribed
to Sokrates are attempts to assign some general concept.</span></p>

<p>Thus finish the three distinct explanations of &Tau;&#8056; &kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#8056;&nu;, which Plato in this dialogue causes to be first suggested by Sokrates, successively accepted by
Hippias, and successively refuted by Sokrates. In comparing them with the three explanations which he puts into the mouth of Hippias, we note this distinction: That the explanations proposed by
Hippias are conspicuous particular exemplifications of the Beautiful, substituted in place of the general concept: as we remarked, in the Dialogue Euthyphron, that the explanations of the Holy given
by Euthyphron in reply to Sokrates, were of the same exemplifying character. On the contrary, those suggested by Sokrates keep in the region of abstractions, and seek to discover some more general
concept, of which the Beautiful is only a derivative or a modification, so as to render a definition of it practicable. To illustrate this difference by the language of Dr. Whewell respecting many of
the classifications in Natural History, we may say &mdash; That according<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page48" id="v2page48"></a>48</span> to the views here represented by Hippias, the group of
objects called beautiful is given by Type, not by Definition:<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_35" href="#Footnotev2_13_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> while Sokrates proceeds like one convinced that some
common characteristic attribute may be found, on which to rest a Definition. To search for Definitions of general words, was (as Aristotle remarks) a novelty, and a valuable novelty, introduced by
Sokrates. His contemporaries, the Sophists among them, were not accustomed to it: and here the Sophist Hippias (according to Plato&rsquo;s frequent manner) is derided as talking nonsense,<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_13_36" href="#Footnotev2_13_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> because, when asked for an explanation of The Self-Beautiful, he answers by citing special instances of beautiful objects.
But we must remember, first, that Sokrates, who is introduced as trying several general explanations of the Self-Beautiful, does not find one which will stand: next, that even if one such could be
found, particular instances can never be dispensed with, in the way of illustration; lastly, that there are many general terms (the Beautiful being one of them) of which no definitions can be
provided, and which can only be imperfectly explained, by enumerating a variety of objects to which the term in question is applied.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_37" href="#Footnotev2_13_37"><span class=
"sp">37</span></a> Plato <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page49" id="v2page49"></a>49</span>thought himself entitled to objectivise every general term, or to assume a substantive Ens, called a Form
or Idea, corresponding to it. This was a logical mistake quite as serious as any which we know to have been committed by Hippias or any other Sophist. The assumption that wherever there is a general
term, there must also be a generic attribute corresponding to it &mdash; is one which Aristotle takes much pains to negative: he recognises terms of transitional analogy, as well as terms equivocal:
while he also especially numbers the Beautiful among equivocal terms.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_38" href="#Footnotev2_13_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a></p>

&ldquo;One of the chief sources of lax habits of thought is the custom of using connotative terms without a distinctly ascertained connotation, and with no more precise notion of their meaning than
can be loosely collected from observing what objects they are used to denote. It is in this manner that we all acquire, and inevitably so, our first knowledge of our vernacular language. A child
learns the meaning of Man, White, &amp;c., by hearing them applied to a number of individual objects, and finding out, by a process of generalisation of which he is but imperfectly conscious, what
those different objects have in common. In many cases objects bear a general resemblance to each other, which leads to their being familiarly classed together under a common name, while it is not
immediately apparent what are the particular attributes upon the possession of which in common by them all their general resemblance depends. In this manner names creep on from subject to subject
until all traces of a common meaning sometimes disappear, and the word comes to denote a number of things not only independently of any common attribute, but which have actually no attribute in
common, or none but what is shared by other things to which the name is capriciously refused. It would be well if this degeneracy of language took place only in the hands of the untaught vulgar; but
some of the most remarkable instances are to be found in terms of art, and among technically educated persons, such as English lawyers. <i>Felony</i>, <i>e.g.</i>, is a law-term with the sound of
which all are familiar: <i>but there is no lawyer who would undertake to tell what a felony is, otherwise than by enumerating the various offences so called.</i> Originally the word <i>felony</i> had
a meaning; it denoted all offences, the penalty of which included forfeiture of lands or goods, but subsequent Acts of Parliament have declared various offences to be felonies without enjoining that
penalty, and have taken away that penalty from others which continue nevertheless to be called felonies, insomuch that the acts so called have now no property whatever in common save that of being
unlawful and punishable.&rdquo;</p>

Memorabilia.</span></p>

<p>We read in the Xenophontic Memorabilia a dialogue between Sokrates and Aristippus, on this same subject &mdash; What is the Beautiful, which affords a sort of contrast between the Dialogues of
Search and those of Exposition. In the Hippias Major, we have the problem approached on several different sides, various suggestions being proposed, and each successively disallowed, on reasons
shown, as failures: while in the Xenophontic dialogue, Sokrates declares an affirmative doctrine, and stands to it &mdash; but no pains are taken to bring out the objections against it and rebut
them. The doctrine is, that the Beautiful is coincident with the Good, and that both of them are resolvable into the Useful: thus all beautiful objects, unlike as they may be to the eye or touch,
bear that name because they have in common the attribute of conducing to one and the same purpose &mdash; the security, advantage, or gratification, of man, in some form or other. This is one of the
three explanations broached by the Platonic Sokrates, and afterwards refuted by him, in the Hippias: while his declaration (which Hippias puts aside as unseemly) &mdash; that a pot and a wooden
soup-ladle conveniently made are beautiful is perfectly in harmony with that of the Xenophontic Sokrates, that a basket for carrying dung is beautiful, if it performs its work well.<a name=

<p>I am obliged to translate the words &tau;&#8056; &Kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#972;&nu; by the Beautiful or beauty, to avoid a tiresome periphrasis. But in reality the Greek words include more besides:
they mean also the <i>fine</i>, the <i>honourable or that which is worthy of honour</i>, the <i>exalted</i>, &amp;c. If we have difficulty in finding any common property connoted by the English word,
the difficulty in the case of the Greek word is still greater.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_13_40" id="Footnotev2_13_40"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_13_40">40</a></span> In regard to the question, Wherein consists &Tau;&#8056;
&Kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#972;&nu;? and objections against the theory of the Xenophontic Sokrates, it is worth while to compare the views of modern philosophers. Dugald Stewart says (on the Beautiful,
&lsquo;Philosophical Essays,&rsquo; p. 214 seq.), &ldquo;It has long been a favourite problem with philosophers to ascertain the common quality or qualities which entitle a thing to the denomination
of Beautiful. But the success of their speculations has been so inconsiderable, that little can be inferred from them except the impossibility of the problem to which they have been directed. The
speculations which have given occasion to these remarks have evidently originated in a prejudice which has descended to modern times from the scholastic ages. That when a word admits of a variety of
significations, these different significations must all be species of the same genus, and must consequently include some essential idea common to every individual to which the generic term can be
applied. Of this principle, which has been an abundant source of obscurity and mystery in the different sciences, it would be easy to expose the unsoundness and futility. Socrates, whose plain good
sense appears, on this as on other occasions, to have fortified his understanding to a wonderful degree against the metaphysical subtleties which misled his successors, was evidently apprised fully
of the justice of the foregoing remarks, if any reliance can be placed on the account given by Xenophon of his conversation with Aristippus about the Good and the Beautiful,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>Stewart then proceeds to translate a portion of the Xenophontic dialogue (Memorab. iii. 8). But unfortunately he does not translate the whole of it. If he had he would have seen that he has
misconceived the opinion of Sokrates, who maintains the very doctrine here disallowed by Stewart, viz., That there is an essential idea common to all beautiful objects, the fact of being conducive to
human security, comfort, or enjoyment. This is unquestionably an important common property, though the multifarious objects which possess it may be unlike in all other respects.</p>

<p>As to the general theory I think that Stewart is right: it is his compliment to Sokrates, on this occasion, which I consider misplaced. He certainly would not have agreed with Sokrates (nor should
I agree with him) in calling by the epithet <i>beautiful</i> a basket for carrying dung when well made for its own purpose, or a convenient boiling-pot, or a soup-ladle made of fig-tree wood, as the
Platonic Sokrates affirms in the Hippias (288 D, 290 D). The Beautiful and the Useful sometimes coincide; more often or at least very often, they do not. Hippias is made to protest, in this dialogue,
against the mention of such vulgar objects as the pot and the ladle; and this is apparently intended by Plato as a defective point in his character, denoting silly affectation and conceit, like his
fine apparel. But Dugald Stewart would have agreed in the sentiment ascribed to Hippias &mdash; that vulgar and mean objects have no place in an inquiry into the Beautiful; and that they belong, when
well-formed for their respective purposes, to the category of the Useful.</p>

<p>The Xenophontic Sokrates in the Memorabilia is mistaken in confounding the Beautiful with the Good and the Useful. But his remarks are valuable in another point of view, as they insist most
forcibly on the essential relativity both of the Beautiful and the Good.</p>

<p>The doctrine of Dugald Stewart is supported by Mr. John Stuart Mill (&lsquo;System of Logic,&rsquo; iv. 4, 5<span class="correction" title=", p. 220 seq.) omitted in 3rd ed.">, p. 220
seq.)</span>; and Professor Bain has expounded the whole subject still more fully in a chapter (xiv. p. 225 seq., on the &AElig;sthetic Emotions) of his work on the Emotions and the Will.</p>
</div>

<p>The concluding observations of this dialogue, interchanged between Hippias and Sokrates, are interesting as bringing out the antithesis between rhetoric and dialectic &mdash; between the concrete
and exemplifying, as contrasted with the abstract and analytical. Immediately after Sokrates has brought his own third suggestion to an inextricable embarrassment, Hippias remarks &mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_24" id="Sidenotev2_13_24"></a> Concluding thrust exchanged between Hippias and Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Sokrates, what do you think now of all these reasonings of yours? They are what I declared them to be just now, &mdash; scrapings and parings of discourse, divided into minute
fragments. But the really beautiful and precious acquirement is, to be able to set out well and finely a regular discourse before the Dikastery or the public assembly, to persuade your auditors, and
to depart carrying with you not the least but the greatest of all prizes &mdash; safety for yourself, your property, and your friends. These are the real objects to strive for. Leave off your petty
cavils, that you may not look like an extreme simpleton, handling silly trifles as you do at present.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_41" href="#Footnotev2_13_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Hippias,&rdquo; (replies Sokrates) &ldquo;you are a happy man, since you know what pursuits a man ought to follow, and have yourself followed them, as you say, with good success.
But I, as it seems, am under the grasp of an unaccountable fortune: for I am always fluctuating and puzzling myself, and when I lay my puzzle before you wise men, I am requited by you with hard
words. I am told just what you have now been telling me, that I busy myself about matters silly, petty, and worthless. When on the contrary, overborne by your authority, I declare as you do, that it
is the finest thing possible to be able to set out well and beautifully a regular discourse before the public assembly, and bring it to successful conclusion &mdash; then there are other men at hand
who heap upon me bitter reproaches: especially that one man, my nearest kinsman and inmate, who never omits to convict me. When on my return home he hears me repeat what you have told me, he asks, if
I am not ashamed of my impudence in talking about beautiful (honourable) pursuits, when I am so <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page52" id="v2page52"></a>52</span>manifestly convicted upon this
subject, of not even knowing what the Beautiful (Honourable) is. How can you (he says), being ignorant what the Beautiful is, know <i>who</i> has set out a discourse beautifully and <i>who</i> has
not &mdash; <i>who</i> has performed a beautiful exploit and <i>who</i> has not? Since you are in a condition so disgraceful, can you think life better for you than death? Such then is my fate
&mdash; to hear disparagement and reproaches from you on the one side, and from him on the other. Necessity however perhaps requires that I should endure all these discomforts: for it will be nothing
strange if I profit by them. Indeed I think that I have already profited both by your society, Hippias, and by his: for I now think that I know what the proverb means &mdash; Beautiful (Honourable)
things are difficult.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_42" href="#Footnotev2_13_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a></p>

<p>Here is a suitable termination for one of the Dialogues of Search: &ldquo;My mind has been embarrassed by contradictions as yet unreconciled, but this is a stage indispensable to future
improvement&rdquo;. We have moreover an interesting passage of arms between Rhetoric and Dialectic: two contemporaneous and contending agencies, among the stirring minds of Athens, in the time of
Plato and Isokrates. The Rhetor accuses the Dialectician of departing from the conditions of reality &mdash; of breaking up the integrity of those concretes, which occur in nature each as continuous
and indivisible wholes. Each of the analogous particular cases forms a continuum or concrete by itself, which may be compared with the others, but cannot be taken to pieces, and studied in separate
fragments.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_43" href="#Footnotev2_13_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> The Dialectician on his side treats the Abstract (&tau;&#8056; &kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#8056;&nu;) as the
real Integer, and the highest abstraction as the first of all integers, containing in itself and capable of evolving all the subordinate integers: the various accompaniments, which go along with each
Abstract to make up a concrete, he disregards as shadowy and transient disguises.</p>

fragments handled, and the subtle transpositions which they underwent in the reasoning. Isokrates again deprecates the over-subtlety of dialectic debate, contrasting it with discussions (in his

<p>One other point deserves peculiar notice, in the dialogue under our review. The problem started is, What is the Beautiful &mdash; the Self-Beautiful, or Beauty <i>per se</i>: and it is assumed
that this must be Something,<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_48" href="#Footnotev2_13_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> that from the accession of which, each particular beautiful thing becomes beautiful. But
Sokrates presently comes to make a distinction between that which is really beautiful and that which appears to be beautiful. Some things (he says) appear beautiful, but are not so in reality: some
are beautiful, but do not appear so. The problem, as he states it, is, to find, not what that is which makes objects appear beautiful, but what it is that makes them really beautiful. This
distinction, as we find it in the language of Hippias, is one of degree only:<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_49" href="#Footnotev2_13_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> that <i>is</i> beautiful which appears
so to every one and at all times. But in the language of Sokrates, the distinction is radical: to <i>be</i> beautiful is one thing, to <i>appear</i> beautiful is another; whatever makes a thing
appear beautiful without being so in reality, is a mere engine of deceit, and not what Sokrates is enquiring for.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_50" href="#Footnotev2_13_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> The
Self-Beautiful or real Beauty is so, whether any one perceives it to be beautiful or not: it is an Absolute, which exists <i>per se</i>, having no relation to any sentient or percipient subject.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_13_51" href="#Footnotev2_13_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> At any rate, such is the manner in which Plato <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page55" id="v2page55">

and Virtue, observes (sect. i. and ii. p. 14-16): &mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beauty is either original or comparative, or, if any like the terms better, absolute or relative; only let it be observed, that by <i>absolute</i> or <i>original</i>, is not understood any
quality supposed to be in the object, which should of itself be beautiful, without relation to any mind which perceives it. For Beauty, like other names of sensible ideas, properly denotes the
perception of some mind.&hellip; Our inquiry is only about the qualities which are beautiful to men, or about the foundation of their sense of beauty, for (as above hinted) Beauty has always relation
to the sense of some mind; and when we afterwards show how generally the objects that occur to us are beautiful, we mean that such objects are agreeable to the sense of men, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same is repeated, sect. iv. p. 40; sect. vi. p. 72.</p>
</div>

<p>Herein we note one of the material points of disagreement between Plato and his master: for Sokrates (in the Xenophontic Memorabilia) affirms distinctly that Beauty is altogether relative to human
wants and appreciations. The Real and Absolute, on the one hand, wherein alone resides truth and beauty &mdash; as against the phenomenal and relative, on the other hand, the world of illusion and
meanness &mdash; this is an antithesis which we shall find often reproduced in Plato. I shall take it up more at large, when I come to discuss his argument against Protagoras in the

<p>I now come to the Lesser Hippias: in which (as we have already seen in the Greater) that Sophist is described by epithets, affirming varied and extensive accomplishments, as master of arithmetic,
geometry, astronomy, poetry (especially that of Homer), legendary lore, music, metrical and rhythmical diversities, &amp;c. His memory was prodigious, and he had even invented for himself a technical
scheme for assisting memory. He had composed poems, epic, lyric, and tragic, as well as many works in prose: he was, besides, a splendid lecturer on ethical and political subjects, and professed to
answer any question which might be asked. Furthermore, he was skilful in many kinds of manual dexterity: having woven his own garments, plaited his own girdle, made his own shoes, engraved his own
seal-ring, and fabricated for himself a curry-comb and oil-flask.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_52" href="#Footnotev2_13_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> Lastly, he is described as wearing fine and showy
apparel. What he is made to say is rather in harmony with this last point of character, than with the preceding. He talks with silliness and presumption, so as to invite and excuse the derisory sting
of Sokrates, There is a third interlocutor, Eudikus: but he says very little, and other auditors are alluded to generally, who say nothing.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_53" href="#Footnotev2_13_53"><span

<p>Ast rejects both the dialogues called by the name of Hippias, as not composed by Plato. Schleiermacher doubts about both, and rejects the Hippias Minor (which he considers as perhaps worked up by
a Platonic scholar from a genuine sketch by Plato himself) but will not pass the same sentence upon the Hippias Major (Schleierm. Einleit. vol. ii. pp. 293-296; vol. v. 399-403. Ast, Platon&rsquo;s
Leben und Schriften, pp. 457-464).</p>

<p>Stallbaum defends both the dialogues as genuine works of Plato, and in my judgment with good reason (Prolegg. ad Hipp. Maj. vol. iv. pp. 145-150; ad Hipp. Minor, pp. 227-235). Steinhart (Einleit.
p. 99) and Socher (Ueber Platon, p. 144 seq., 215 seq.) maintain the same opinion on these dialogues as Stallbaum. It is to be remarked that Schleiermacher states the reasons both for and against the
genuineness of the dialogues; and I think that even in his own statement the reasons <i>for</i> preponderate. The reasons which both Schleiermacher and Ast produce as proving the spuriousness, are in
my view quite insufficient to sustain their conclusion. There is bad taste, sophistry, an overdose of banter and derision (they say very truly), in the part assigned to Sokrates: there are also
differences of view, as compared with Sokrates in other dialogues; various other affirmations (they tell us) are <i>not</i> Platonic. I admit much of this, but I still do not accept their conclusion.
These critics cannot bear to admit any Platonic work as genuine unless it affords to them ground for superlative admiration and glorification of the author. This postulate I altogether contest; and I
think that differences of view, as between Sokrates in one dialogue and Sokrates in another, are both naturally to be expected and actually manifested (witness the Protagoras and Gorgias). Moreover
Ast designates (p. 404) a doctrine as &ldquo;durchaus unsokratisch&rdquo; which Stallbaum justly remarks (p. 233) to have been actually affirmed by Sokrates in the Xenophontic Memorabilia. Stallbaum
thinks that both the two dialogues (Socher, that the Hippias Minor only) were composed by Plato among his earlier works, and this may probably be true. The citation and refutation of the Hippias
Minor by Aristotle (Metaphys. &Delta;. 1025, a. 6) counts with me as a strong corroborative proof that the dialogue is Plato&rsquo;s work. Schleiermacher and Ast set this evidence aside because
Aristotle does not name Plato as the author. But if the dialogue had been composed by any one less celebrated than Plato, Aristotle would have named the author. Mention by Aristotle, though without
Plato&rsquo;s name, is of greater value to support the genuineness than the purely internal grounds stated by Ast and Schleiermacher against it.</p>

extols Achilles as better than Odysseus &mdash; the veracious and straightforward hero better than the mendacious and crafty.</span></p>

<p>In the Hippias Minor, that Sophist appears as having just concluded a lecture upon Homer, in which he had extolled Achilles as better than Odysseus: Achilles being depicted as veracious and
straightforward, Odysseus as mendacious and full of tricks. Sokrates, who had been among the auditors, cross-examines Hippias upon the subject of this affirmation.</p>

<p>Homer (says Hippias) considers veracious men, and mendacious men, to be not merely different, but opposite: and I agree with him. Permit me (Sokrates remarks) to ask some questions about the
meaning of this from you, since I cannot ask any from Homer himself. You will answer both for yourself and him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_54" href="#Footnotev2_13_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a></p>

<p>The remark here made by Sokrates &mdash; &ldquo;The poet is not here to answer for himself, so that you cannot put any questions to him&rdquo; is a point of view familiar to Plato: insisted upon
forcibly in the Protagoras (347 E), and farther generalised in the Ph&aelig;drus, so as to apply to all written matter compared with personal converse (Ph&aelig;drus, p. 275 D).</p>

<p>This ought to count, so far as it goes, as a fragment of proof that the Hippias Minor is a genuine work of Plato, instead of which Schleiermacher treats it (p. 295) as evincing a poor copy, made
by some imitator of Plato, from the Protagoras.</p>

can answer truly if he chooses, is he who can also answer falsely if he chooses, <i>i.e.</i> the knowing man &mdash; the ignorant man cannot make sure of doing either the one or the other.</span></p>

<p>You, Hippias (says Sokrates), are expert on matters of arithmetic: you can make sure of answering truly any question put to you on the subject. You are <i>better</i> on the subject than the
ignorant man, who cannot make sure of doing the same. But as you can make sure of answering truly, so likewise you can make sure of answering falsely, whenever you choose to do so. Now the ignorant
man cannot make sure of answering falsely. He may, by reason of his ignorance, when he wishes to answer falsely, answer truly without intending it. You, therefore, the intelligent man and the good in
arithmetic, are better than the ignorant and the bad for both purposes &mdash; for speaking falsely, and for speaking truly.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_56" href="#Footnotev2_13_56"><span class=

<p>Upon this point, Hippias (says Sokrates), I dissent from you entirely. I am, unhappily, a stupid person, who cannot find out the reality of things: and this appears plainly enough when I come to
talk with wise men like you, for I always find myself differing from you. My only salvation consists in my earnest anxiety to put questions and learn from you, and in my gratitude for your answers
and teaching. I think that those who hurt mankind, or cheat, or lie, or do wrong, <i>wilfully</i> &mdash; are better than those who do the same <i>unwillingly</i>. Sometimes, indeed, from my
stupidity, the opposite view presents itself to me, and I become confused: but now, after talking with you, the fit of confidence has come round upon me again, to pronounce and characterise the
persons who do wrong <i>unwillingly</i>, as worse than those who do wrong <i>wilfully</i>. I entreat you to heal this disorder of my <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page59" id="v2page59">
</a>59</span>mind. You will do me much more good than if you cured my body of a distemper. But it will be useless for you to give me one of your long discourses: for I warn you that I cannot follow
it. The only way to confer upon me real service, will be to answer my questions again, as you have hitherto done. Assist me, Eudikus, in persuading Hippias to do so.</p>

<p>Assistance from me (says Eudikus) will hardly be needed, for Hippias professed himself ready to answer any man&rsquo;s questions.</p>

<p>Yes &mdash; I did so (replies Hippias) &mdash; but Sokrates always brings trouble into the debate, and proceeds like one disposed to do mischief.</p>

<p>Eudikus repeats his request, and Hippias, in deference to him, consents to resume the task of answering.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_61" href="#Footnotev2_13_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a></p>

<p>Sokrates then produces a string of questions, with a view to show that those who do wrong wilfully, are better than those who do wrong unwillingly. He appeals to various analogies. In running, the
good runner is he who runs quickly, the bad runner is he who runs slowly. What is evil and base in running is, to run slowly. It is the good runner who does this evil wilfully: it is the bad runner
who does it unwillingly.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_62" href="#Footnotev2_13_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> The like is true about wrestling and other bodily exercises. He that is good in the body,

unwillingly, not being able to help it.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_63" href="#Footnotev2_13_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will here again remind the reader, that in this, as in the other dialogues, the real speaker is Plato throughout: and that <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page62" id="v2page62"></a>62</span>it
is he alone who prefixes the different names to words determined by himself.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_39" id="Sidenotev2_13_39"></a> Remarks on the dialogue. If the parts had been inverted, the dialogue would have been cited by critics as a specimen of
the sophistry and corruption of the Sophists.</span></p>

<p>Now, if the dialogue just concluded had come down to us with the parts inverted, and with the reasoning of Sokrates assigned to Hippias, most critics would probably have produced it as a tissue of
sophistry justifying the harsh epithets which they bestow upon the Athenian Sophists &mdash; as persons who considered truth and falsehood to be on a par &mdash; subverters of morality &mdash; and
corruptors of the youth of Athens.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_69" href="#Footnotev2_13_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> But as we read it, all that, which in the mouth of Hippias would have passed for
sophistry, is here put forward by Sokrates; while Hippias not only resists his conclusions, and adheres to the received ethical sentiment tenaciously, even when he is unable to defend it, but hates
the propositions forced upon him, protests against the perverse captiousness of Sokrates, and requires much pressing to induce him to continue the debate. Upon the views adopted by the critics,
Hippias ought to receive credit for this conduct, as a friend of virtue and morality. To me, such reluctance to debate appears a defect rather than a merit; but I cite the dialogue as illustrating
what I have already said in another place &mdash; that <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page63" id="v2page63"></a>63</span>Sokrates and Plato threw out more startling novelties in ethical doctrine,
than either Hippias or Protagoras, or any of the other persons denounced as Sophists.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_13_69" id="Footnotev2_13_69"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_13_69">69</a></span> Accordingly one of the Platonic critics, Schwalbe (&OElig;uvres de
Platon, p. 116), explains Plato&rsquo;s purpose in the Hippias Minor by saying, that Sokrates here serves out to the Sophists a specimen of their own procedure, and gives them an example of
sophistical dialectic, by defending a sophistical thesis in a sophistical manner: That he chooses and demonstrates at length the thesis &mdash; the liar is not different from the truth-teller &mdash;
as an exposure of the sophistical art of proving the contrary of any given proposition, and for the purpose of deriding and unmasking the false morality of Hippias, who in this dialogue talks
reasonably enough.</p>

<p>Schwalbe, while he affirms that this is the purpose of Plato, admits that the part here assigned to Sokrates is unworthy of him; and Steinhart maintains that Plato never could have had any such
purpose, &ldquo;however frequently&rdquo; (Steinhart says), &ldquo;sophistical artifices may occur in this conversation of Sokrates, which artifices Sokrates no more disdained to employ than any
other philosopher or rhetorician of that day&rdquo; (&ldquo;so h&auml;ufig auch in seinen Er&ouml;rterungen sophistische Kunstgriffe vorkommen m&ouml;gen, die Sokrates eben so wenig verschmaht hat,
als irgend ein Philosoph oder Redek&uuml;nstler dieser Zeit&rdquo;). Steinhart, Einleitung zum Hipp. Minor, p. 109.</p>

<p>I do not admit the purpose here ascribed to Plato by Schwalbe, but I refer to the passage as illustrating what Platonic critics think of the reasoning assigned to Sokrates in the Hippias Minor,
and the hypotheses which they introduce to colour it.</p>

<p>The passage cited from Steinhart also &mdash; that Sokrates no more disdained to employ sophistical artifices than any other philosopher or rhetorician of the age &mdash; is worthy of note, as
coming from one who is so very bitter in his invectives against the sophistry of the persons called Sophists, of which we have no specimens left.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_40" id="Sidenotev2_13_40"></a> Polemical purpose of the dialogue &mdash; Hippias humiliated by Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>That Plato intended to represent this accomplished Sophist as humiliated by Sokrates, is evident enough: and the words put into his mouth are suited to this purpose. The eloquent lecturer, so soon
as his admiring crowd of auditors has retired, proves unable to parry the questions of a single expert dialectician who remains behind, upon a matter which appears to him almost self-evident, and
upon which every one (from Homer downward) agrees with him. Besides this, however, Plato is not satisfied without making him say very simple and absurd things. All this is the personal, polemical,
comic scope of the dialogue. It lends (whether well-placed or not) a certain animation and variety, which the author naturally looked out for, in an aggregate of dialogues all handling analogous
matters about man and society.</p>

<p>But though the polemical purpose of the dialogue is thus plain, its philosophical purpose perplexes the critics considerably. They do not like to see Sokrates employing sophistry against the
Sophists: that is, as they think, casting out devils by the help of Beelzebub. And certainly, upon the theory which they adopt, respecting the relation between Plato and Sokrates on one side, and the
Sophists on the other, I think this dialogue is very difficult to explain. But I do not think it is difficult, upon a true theory of the Platonic writings.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_41" id="Sidenotev2_13_41"></a> Philosophical purpose of the dialogue &mdash; theory of the Dialogues of Search generally, and of Knowledge as
understood by Plato.</span></p>

<p>In a former chapter, I tried to elucidate the general character and purpose of those Dialogues of Search, which occupy more than half the Thrasyllean
Canon, and of which we have already reviewed two or three specimens &mdash; Euthyphron, Alkibiad&ecirc;s, &amp;c. We have seen that they are distinguished by the absence of any affirmative conclusion:
that they prove nothing, but only, at the most, disprove one or more supposable solutions: that they are not processes in which one man who knows communicates his knowledge to ignorant hearers, but
in which all are alike ignorant, and all are employed, either in groping, or guessing, or testing the guesses of the rest. We have farther seen that the value of these <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page64" id="v2page64"></a>64</span>Dialogues depends upon the Platonic theory about knowledge; that Plato did not consider any one to know, who could not explain to others all that he knew, reply
to the cross-examination of a Sokratic Elenchus, and cross-examine others to test their knowledge: that knowledge in this sense could not be attained by hearing, or reading, or committing to memory a
theorem, together with the steps of reasoning which directly conducted to it: &mdash; but that there was required, besides, an acquaintance with many counter-theorems, each having more or less
appearance of truth; as well as with various embarrassing aspects and plausible delusions on the subject, which an expert cross-examiner would not fail to urge. Unless you are practised in meeting
all the difficulties which he can devise, you cannot be said <i>to know</i>. Moreover, it is in this last portion of the conditions of knowledge, that most aspirants are found wanting.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_42" id="Sidenotev2_13_42"></a> The Hippias is an exemplification of this theory &mdash; Sokrates sets forth a case of confusion, and avows his
inability to clear it up. Confusion shown up in the Lesser Hippias &mdash; Error in the Greater.</span></p>

<p>Now the Greater and Lesser Hippias are peculiar specimens of these Dialogues of Search, and each serves the purpose above indicated. The Greater Hippias enumerates a string of tentatives, each one
of which ends in acknowledged failure: the Lesser Hippias enunciates a thesis, which Sokrates proceeds to demonstrate, by plausible arguments such as Hippias is forced to admit. But though Hippias
admits each successive step, he still mistrusts the conclusion, and suspects that he has been misled &mdash; a feeling which Plato<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_70" href="#Footnotev2_13_70"><span class=
"sp">70</span></a> describes elsewhere as being frequent among the respondents of Sokrates. Nay, Sokrates himself shares in the mistrust &mdash; presents himself as an unwilling propounder of
arguments which force themselves upon him,<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_71" href="#Footnotev2_13_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> and complains of his own mental embarrassment. Now you may call this
sophistry, if you please; and you may silence <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page65" id="v2page65"></a>65</span>its propounders by calling them hard names. But such ethical prudery &mdash; hiding
all the uncomfortable logical puzzles which start up when you begin to analyse an established sentiment, and treating them as non-existent because you refuse to look at them &mdash; is not the way,
to attain what Plato calls knowledge. If there be any argument, the process of which seems indisputable, while yet its conclusion contradicts, or seems to contradict, what is known, upon other
evidence &mdash; the full and patient analysis of that argument is indispensable, before you can become master of the truth and able to defend it. Until you have gone through such analysis, your mind
must remain in that state of confusion which is indicated by Sokrates at the end of the Lesser Hippias. As it is a part of the process of Search, to travel in the path of the Greater Hippias &mdash;
that is, to go through a string of erroneous solutions, each of which can be proved, by reasons shown, to <i>be</i> erroneous: so it is an equally important part of the same process, to travel in the
path of the Lesser Hippias &mdash; that is, to acquaint ourselves with all those arguments, bearing on the case, in which two contrary conclusions appear to be both of them plausibly demonstrated,
and in which therefore we cannot as yet determine which of them is erroneous &mdash; or whether both are not erroneous. The Greater Hippias exhibits errors, &mdash; the Lesser Hippias puts before us
confusion. With both these enemies the Searcher for truth must contend: and Bacon tells us, that confusion is the worst enemy of the two &mdash; &ldquo;Citius emergit veritas ex errore, quam ex
confusione&rdquo;. Plato, in the Lesser Hippias, having in hand a genuine Sokratic thesis, does not disdain to invest Sokrates with the task (sophistical, as some call it, yet not the less useful and
instructive) of setting forth at large this case of confusion, and avowing his inability to clear it up. It is enough for Sokrates that he brings home the painful sense of confusion to the feelings
of his hearer as well as to his own. In that painful sentiment lies the stimulus provocative of farther intellectual effort.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_72" href="#Footnotev2_13_72"><span class=
"sp">72</span></a> The dialogue ends but the process of search, far from ending along with it, is emphatically declared to be unfinished, and, to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page66" id=
"v2page66"></a>66</span>in a condition not merely unsatisfactory but intolerable, not to be relieved except by farther investigation, which thus becomes a necessary sequel.</p>

</div>

<p>There are two circumstances which lend particular interest to this dialogue &mdash; Hippias Minor. 1. That the thesis out of which the confusion arises, is one which we know to have been laid down
by the historical Sokrates himself. 2. That Aristotle expressly notices this thesis, as well as the dialogue in which it is contained, and combats it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_43" id="Sidenotev2_13_43"></a> The thesis maintained here by Sokrates, is also affirmed by the historical Sokrates in the Xenophontic
Memorabilia.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates in his conversation with the youthful Euthydemus (in the Xenophontic Memorabilia) maintains, that of two persons, each of whom deceives his friends in a manner to produce mischief, the
one who does so wilfully is not so unjust as the one who does so unwillingly.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_73" href="#Footnotev2_13_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a> Euthydemus (like Hippias in this
dialogue) maintains the opposite, but is refuted by Sokrates; who argues that justice is a matter to be learnt and known like letters; that the lettered man, who has learnt and knows letters, can
write wrongly when he chooses, but never writes wrongly unless he chooses &mdash; while it is only the unlettered man who writes wrongly unwillingly and without intending it: that in like manner the
just man, he that has learnt and knows justice, never commits injustice unless when he intends it &mdash; while the unjust man, who has not learnt and does not know justice, commits injustice whether
he will or not. It is the just man therefore, and none but the just man (Sokrates maintains), who commits injustice knowingly and wilfully: it is the unjust man who commits injustice without wishing
or intending it.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_74" href="#Footnotev2_13_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>This is the same view which is worked out by the Platonic Sokrates in the Hippias Minor: beginning with the antithesis between the veracious and mendacious man (as Sokrates begins in Xenophon);
and concluding with the general result &mdash; that it <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page67" id="v2page67"></a>67</span>belongs to the good man to do wrong wilfully, to the bad man to do wrong
unwillingly.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_44" id="Sidenotev2_13_44"></a> Aristotle combats the thesis. Arguments against it.</span></p>

<p>Aristotle,<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_75" href="#Footnotev2_13_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> in commenting upon this doctrine of the Hippias Minor, remarks justly, that Plato understands the
epithets <i>veracious</i> and <i>mendacious</i> in a sense different from that which they usually bear. Plato understands the words as designating one who <i>can</i> tell the truth if he chooses
&mdash; one who <i>can</i> speak falsely if he chooses: and in this sense he argues plausibly that the two epithets go together, and that no man can be mendacious unless he be also veracious.
Aristotle points out that the epithets in their received meaning are applied, not to the power itself, but to the habitual and intentional use of that power. The power itself is doubtless presupposed
or implied as one condition to the applicability of the epithets, and is one common condition to the applicability of both epithets: but the distinction, which they are intended to draw, regards the
intentions and dispositions with which the power is employed. So also Aristotle observes that Plato&rsquo;s conclusion &mdash; &ldquo;He that does wrong wilfully is a better man than he that does
wrong unwillingly,&rdquo; is falsely collected from induction or analogy. The analogy of the special arts and accomplishments, upon which the argument is built, is not applicable. <i>Better</i> has
reference, not to the amount of intelligence but to the dispositions and habitual intentions; though it presupposes a certain state and amount of intelligence as indispensable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_45" id="Sidenotev2_13_45"></a> Mistake of Sokrates and Plato in dwelling too exclusively on the intellectual conditions of human conduct.</span></p>

<p>Both Sokrates and Plato (in many of his dialogues) commit the error of which the above is one particular manifestation &mdash; that of dwelling exclusively on the intellectual conditions of human
conduct,<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_76" href="#Footnotev2_13_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a> and omitting to give proper attention to the emotional and volitional, as essentially co-operating or
preponderating in the complex meaning of ethical attributes. The reasoning ascribed to the Platonic Sokrates in the Hippias <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page68" id="v2page68"></a>68</span>Minor
exemplifies this one-sided view. What he says is true, but it is only a part of the truth. When he speaks of a person &ldquo;who does wrong unwillingly,&rdquo; he seems to have in view one who does
wrong without knowing that he does so: one whose intelligence is so defective that he does not know when he speaks truth and when he speaks falsehood. Now a person thus unhappily circumstanced must
be regarded as half-witted or imbecile, coming under the head which the Xenophontic Sokrates called <i>madness</i>:<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_77" href="#Footnotev2_13_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a>
unfit to perform any part in society, and requiring to be placed under tutelage. Compared with such a person, the opinion of the Platonic Sokrates may be defended &mdash; that the mendacious person,
who <i>can</i> tell truth when he chooses, is the better of the two in the sense of less mischievous or dangerous. But he is the object of a very different sentiment; moreover, this is not the
comparison present to our minds when we call one man veracious, another man mendacious. We always assume, in every one, a measure of intelligence equal or superior to the admissible minimum; under
such assumption, we compare two persons, one of whom speaks to the best of his knowledge and belief, the other, contrary to his knowledge and belief. We approve the former and disapprove the latter,
according to the different intention and purpose of each (as Aristotle observes); that is, looking at them under the point of view of emotion and volition &mdash; which is logically distinguishable
from the intelligence, though always acting in conjunction with it.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_13_76" id="Footnotev2_13_76"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_13_76">76</a></span> Aristotle has very just observations on these views of Sokrates, and
on the incompleteness of his views when he resolved all virtue into knowledge, all vice into ignorance. See, among other passages, Aristot. Ethica Magna, i. 1182, a. 16; 1183, b. 9; 1190, b. 28;

epithets of praise and blame.</span></p>

<p>Again, the analogy of the special arts, upon which the Platonic Sokrates dwells in the Hippias Minor, fails in sustaining his inference. By a good runner, wrestler, harper, singer, speaker,
&amp;c., we undoubtedly mean one who can, if he pleases, perform some one of these operations well; although he can also, if he pleases, perform them badly. But the epithets <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i>,
in this case, consider exclusively that element which was left out, and leave out that element which was exclusively considered, in the former case. The good singer is declared to stand distinguished
from the bad <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page69" id="v2page69"></a>69</span>singer, or from the &#7984;&delta;&iota;&#974;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, who, if he sings at all, will certainly sing badly,
by an attribute belonging to his intelligence and vocal organs. To sing well is a special accomplishment, which is possessed only by a few, and which no man is blamed for not possessing. The
distinction between such special accomplishments, and justice or rectitude of behaviour, is well brought out in the speech which Plato puts into the mouth of the Sophist Protagoras.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_13_78" href="#Footnotev2_13_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> &ldquo;The special artists (he says) are few in number: one of them is sufficient for many private citizens. But every
citizen, without exception, must possess justice and a sense of shame: if he does not, he must be put away as a nuisance &mdash; otherwise, society could not be maintained.&rdquo; The special artist
is a citizen also; and as such, must be subject to the obligations binding on all citizens universally. In predicating of him that he is <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> as a citizen, we merely assume him
to possess the average intelligence, of the community; and the epithet declares whether his emotional and volitional attributes exceed, or fall short of, the minimum required in the application of
that intelligence to his social obligations. It is thus that the words <i>good</i> or <i>bad</i> when applied to him as a citizen, have a totally different bearing from that which the same words have

question under review.</span></p>

<p>The value of these debates in the Platonic dialogues consists in their raising questions like the preceding, for the reflection of the reader &mdash; whether the Platonic Sokrates may or may not
be represented as taking what we think the right view of the question. For a Dialogue of Search, the great merit is, that it should be suggestive; that it should bring before our attention the
conditions requisite for a right and proper use of these common ethical epithets, and the state of circumstances which is tacitly implied whenever any one uses them. No man ever learns to reflect
upon the meaning of such familiar epithets, which he has been using all his life &mdash; unless the process be forced upon his attention by some special conversation which brings home to him an
uncomfortable sentiment of perplexity and contradiction. If a man intends to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page70" id="v2page70"></a>70</span>acquire any grasp of ethical or political theory, he
must render himself master, not only of the sound arguments and the guiding analogies but also of the unsound arguments and the misleading analogies, which bear upon each portion of it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_13_48" id="Sidenotev2_13_48"></a> Antithesis between Rhetoric and Dialectic.</span></p>

<p>There is one other point of similitude deserving notice, between the Greater and Lesser Hippias. In both of them, Hippias makes special complaint of Sokrates, for breaking the question in pieces
and picking out the minute puzzling fragments &mdash; instead of keeping it together as a whole, and applying to it the predicates which it merits when so considered.<a name="FnAnchorv2_13_79" href=
"#Footnotev2_13_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> Here is the standing antithesis between Rhetoric and Dialectic: between those unconsciously acquired mental combinations which are poured out in
eloquent, impressive, unconditional, and undistinguishing generalities &mdash; and the logical analysis which resolves the generality into its specialities, bringing to view inconsistencies,
contradictions, limits, qualifications, &amp;c. I have already touched upon this at the close of the Greater Hippias.</p>

<h2><a name="Platovol2ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h2>HIPPARCHUS &mdash; MINOS.</h2>

<p>In these two dialogues, Plato sets before us two farther specimens of that error and confusion which beset the enquirer during his search after &ldquo;reasoned truth&rdquo;. Sokrates forces upon
the attention of a companion two of the most familiar words of the market-place, to see whether a clear explanation of their meaning can be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_1" id="Sidenotev2_14_1"></a> Hipparchus &mdash; Question &mdash; What is the definition of Lover of Gain? He is one who thinks it right to gain from
things worth nothing. Sokrates cross-examines upon this explanation. No man expects to gain from things which he knows to be worth nothing: in this sense, no man is a lover of gain.</span></p>

<p>In the dialogue called Hipparchus, the debate turns on the definition of &tau;&#8056; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&#8050;&sigmaf; or &#8001;
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&#942;&sigmaf; &mdash; the love of gain or the lover of gain. Sokrates asks his Companion to define the word. The Companion replies &mdash; He
is one who thinks it right to gain from things worth nothing.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_1" href="#Footnotev2_14_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Does he do this (asks Sokrates) knowing that the things
are worth nothing? or not knowing? If the latter, he is simply ignorant. He knows it perfectly well (is the reply). He is cunning and wicked; and it is because he cannot resist the temptation of
gain, that he has the impudence to make profit by such things, though well aware that they are worth nothing. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Suppose a husbandman, knowing that the plant which he is tending is
worthless &mdash; and yet thinking that he ought to gain by it: does not that correspond to your description of the lover of gain? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; The lover of gain, Sokrates, thinks that he
ought to gain from every thing. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do not answer in that reckless manner,<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_2" href="#Footnotev2_14_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> as if you had been wronged
by any one; but answer with <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page72" id="v2page72"></a>72</span>attention. You agree that the lover of gain knows the value of that from which he intends to derive
profit; and that the husbandman is the person cognizant of the value of plants. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Yes: I agree. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do not therefore attempt, you are so young, to deceive an old
man like me, by giving answers not in conformity with your own admissions; but tell me plainly, Do you believe that the experienced husbandman, when he knows that he is planting a tree worth nothing,
thinks that he shall gain by it? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; No, certainly: I do not believe it.</p>

<p>Sokrates then proceeds to multiply illustrations to the same general point. The good horseman does not expect to gain by worthless food given to his horse: the good pilot, by worthless tackle put
into his ship: the good commander, by worthless arms delivered to his soldiers: the good fifer, harper, bowman, by employing worthless instruments of their respective arts, if they know them to be
worthless.</p>

href="#Footnotev2_14_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; I mean, Sokrates, that the lovers of gain are those, who, through greediness, long eagerly for things altogether petty and
worthless; and thus display a love of gain.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_4" href="#Footnotev2_14_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Not surely knowing them to be worthless &mdash; for
this we have shown to be impossible &mdash; but ignorant that they are worthless, and believing them to be valuable. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; It appears so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now gain is the opposite
of loss: and loss is evil and hurt to every one: therefore gain (as the opposite of loss) is good. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Yes. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; It appears then that the lovers of good are those
whom you call lovers of gain? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Yes: it appears so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do not you yourself love good &mdash; all good things? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Certainly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash;
And I too, and every one else. All men love good things, and hate evil. Now we agreed that gain was a good: so that by this reasoning, it appears that all men are lovers of gain while by the former
reasoning, we made out that none were so.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_5" href="#Footnotev2_14_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Which of the two <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page73" id="v2page73">
</a>73</span>shall we adopt, to avoid error. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; We shall commit no error, Sokrates, if we rightly conceive the lover of gain. He is one who busies himself upon, and seeks to gain
from, things from which good men do not venture to gain.</p>

any useful and good thing is evil? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; No. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Well! we agreed just now that gain was the opposite of loss, which was evil; and that, being the opposite of evil,
gain was good. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; That was what we agreed. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You see how it is: you are trying to deceive me: you purposely contradict what we just now agreed upon. <i>Comp.</i>

Hipparchus by Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates then describes at some length the excellent character of Hipparchus: his beneficent rule, his wisdom, his anxiety for the moral improvement of the Athenians: the causes, different from
what was commonly believed, which led to his death; and the wholesome precepts which he during his life had caused to be inscribed on various busts of Hermes throughout Attica. One of these busts or
Herm&aelig; bore the words &mdash; Do not deceive a friend.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_7" href="#Footnotev2_14_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a></p>

<p>The picture here given of Hipparchus deserves notice. We are informed that he was older than his brother Hippias, which was the general belief at Athens, as Thucydides (i. 20, vi. 58) affirms,
though himself contradicting it, and affirming that Hippias was the elder brother. Plato however agrees with Thucydides in this point, that the three years after the assassination of Hipparchus,
during which Hippias ruled alone, were years of oppression and tyranny; and that the hateful recollection of the Peisistratid&aelig;, which always survived in the minds of the Athenians, was derived
from these three last years.</p>

<p>The picture which Plato here gives of Hipparchus is such as we might expect from a philosopher. He dwells upon the pains which Hipparchus took to have the recitation of the Homeric poems made
frequent and complete: also upon his intimacy with the poets Anakreon and Simonides. The colouring which Plato gives to the intimacy between Aristogeiton and Harmodius is also peculiar. The
&#7952;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&#8052;&sigmaf; is represented by Plato as eager for the education and improvement of the &#7952;&rho;&#974;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;; and the jealousy felt
towards Hipparchus is described as arising from the distinguished knowledge and abilities of Hipparchus, which rendered him so much superior and more effective as an educator.</p>

which both are called Gain? Every acquisition, made with no outlay, or with a smaller outlay, is gain. Objections &mdash; the acquisition may be evil &mdash; embarrassment confessed.</span></p>

<p>But tell me: you say that if a man lays out little and acquires much, that is gain? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Yes: but not if it be evil: it is gain, if it be good, like gold or silver. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; I will ask you about gold and silver. Suppose a man by laying out one pound of gold acquires two pounds of silver, is it gain or loss? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; It is loss, decidedly, Sokrates:
gold is twelve times the value of silver. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Nevertheless he has acquired more: double is more than half. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Not in value: double silver is not more than half
gold. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; It appears then that we must include value as essential to gain, not merely quantity. The valuable is gain: the valueless is no gain. The valuable is that which is valuable
to possess: is that the profitable, or the unprofitable? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; It is the profitable. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But the profitable is good? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Yes: it is. <i>Sokr.</i>

is the common constituent attribute?</span></p>

<p>The Minos, like the Hipparchus, is a dialogue carried on between Sokrates and a companion not named. It relates to Law, or The Law &mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What is Law (asks Sokrates)? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Respecting what sort of Law do you enquire (replies the Companion)? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What! is there any difference
between one law and another law, as to that identical circumstance, of being Law? Gold does not differ from gold, so far as the being gold is concerned &mdash; nor stone from stone, so far as being
stone is concerned. In like manner, one law does not differ from another, all are the same, in so far as each is Law alike:&mdash; not, one of them more, and another less. It is about this as a whole
that I ask you &mdash; What is Law?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_10" id="Sidenotev2_14_10"></a> Answer &mdash; Law is, 1. The consecrated and binding customs. 2. The decree of the city. 3. Social or civic
opinion.</span></p>

<p><i>Comp.</i> &mdash; What should Law be, Sokrates, other than the various assemblage of consecrated and binding customs and beliefs?<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_15" href="#Footnotev2_14_15"><span class=
"sp">15</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do you think, then, that discourse <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page77" id="v2page77"></a>77</span>is, the things spoken: that sight is, the things seen?
that hearing is, the things heard? Or are they not distinct, in each of the three cases &mdash; and is not Law also one thing, the various customs and beliefs another? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Yes! I now
think that they are distinct.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_16" href="#Footnotev2_14_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Law is that whereby these binding customs become binding. What is

<i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Justice and Law, are highly honourable: injustice and lawlessness, highly dishonourable: the former preserves cities, the latter ruins them. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Yes &mdash; it
does. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Well, then! we must consider law as something honourable; and seek after it, under the assumption that it is a good thing. You defined law to be the decree of the city: Are
not some decrees good, others evil? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Unquestionably. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But we have already said that law is not evil. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; I admit it. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; It

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Still &mdash; I think, myself, that law is opinion of some sort; and since it is not evil opinion, it must be good opinion. Now good opinion is true opinion: and true opinion
is, the finding out of reality. <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; I admit it. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Law therefore wishes or tends to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page78" id="v2page78"></a>78</span>be, the

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Perhaps you are right, and these matters have escaped me. But if you and I go on making long speeches each for ourselves, we shall never come to an agreement. If we are to

&mdash; Minos and Rhadamanthus, sons of Zeus and Europa? <i>Comp.</i> &mdash; Rhadamanthus certainly is said to have been a just man, Sokrates; but Minos quite the reverse &mdash; savage,
ill-tempered, unjust. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What you affirm, my friend, is a fiction of the Attic tragedians. It is not stated either by Homer or Hesiod, who are far more worthy of credit than all the

<p>Sokrates replies by citing, and commenting upon, the statements of Homer and Hesiod respecting Minos, as the cherished son, companion, and pupil, of Zeus; who bestowed upon him an admirable
training, teaching him wisdom and justice, and thus rendering him consummate as a lawgiver and ruler of men. It was through these laws, divine as emanating from the teaching of Zeus, that Krete (and
Sparta as the imitator of Krete) had been for so long a period happy and virtuous. As ruler of Krete, Minos had made war upon Athens, and compelled the Athenians to pay tribute. Hence he had become
odious to the Athenians, and especially odious to the tragic poets who were the great teachers and charmers of the crowd. These poets, whom every one ought to be cautious of offending, had
calumniated Minos as the old enemy of Athens.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_27" href="#Footnotev2_14_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_21" id="Sidenotev2_14_21"></a> The Hipparchus and Minos are analogous to each other, and both of them inferior works of Plato, perhaps
unfinished.</span></p>

<p>I have put together the two dialogues Hipparchus and Minos, partly because of the analogy which really exists between them, partly because that analogy is much insisted on by Boeckh,
Schleiermacher, Stallbaum, and other recent critics; who not only strike them both out of the list of Platonic works, but speak of them with contempt as compositions. On the first point, I dissent
from them altogether: on the second, I agree with them thus far &mdash; that I consider the two dialogues inferior works of Plato:&mdash; much inferior to his greatest and best compositions, &mdash;
certainly displaying both less genius and less careful elaboration &mdash; probably among his early performances &mdash; perhaps even unfinished projects, destined for a farther elaboration, which
they never received, and not published until after his decease. Yet in Hipparchus as well as in Minos, the subjects debated are important as regards ethical theory. Several questions are raised and
partially canvassed: no conclusion is finally attained. These characteristics they have in common with several of the best Platonic dialogues.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_22" id="Sidenotev2_14_22"></a> Hipparchus &mdash; Double meaning of &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&#8052;&sigmaf; and
&kappa;&#941;&rho;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;.</span></p>

<p>In Hipparchus, the question put by Sokrates is, about the definition of &#8001; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&#8052;&sigmaf; (the lover of gain), and of
&kappa;&#941;&rho;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf; itself &mdash; gain. The first of these two words (like many in Greek as well as in English) is used in two senses. In its plain, etymological sense, it
means an attribute belonging to all men: all men love gain, hate loss. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page83" id="v2page83"></a>83</span>But since this is predicable of all, there is seldom any
necessity for predicating it of any one man or knot of men in particular. Accordingly, when you employ the epithet as a predicate of A or B, what you generally mean is, to assert something more than
its strict etymological meaning: to declare that he has the attribute in unusual measure; or that he has shown himself, on various occasions, wanting in other attributes, which on those occasions
ought, in your judgment, to have countervailed it. The epithet thus comes to connote a sentiment of blame or reproach, in the mind of the speaker.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_30" href=
"#Footnotev2_14_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_14_30" id="Footnotev2_14_30"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_14_30">30</a></span> Aristotle adverts to this class of ethical epithets, connoting both an
attribute in the person designated and an unfavourable sentiment in the speaker (Ethic. Nikom. ii. 6, p. 1107, a. 9). &Omicron;&#8016; &pi;&#8118;&sigma;&alpha; &delta;&rsquo;

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_23" id="Sidenotev2_14_23"></a> State or mind of the agent, as to knowledge, frequent inquiry in Plato. No tenable definition found.</span></p>

<p>The Companion or Collocutor, being called upon by Sokrates to explain &tau;&#8056; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&#8050;&sigmaf;, defines it in this last sense, as
conveying or connoting a reproach. He gives three different explanations of it (always in this sense), each of which Sokrates shows to be untenable. A variety of parallel cases are compared, and the
question is put (so constantly recurring in Plato&rsquo;s writings), what is the state of the agent&rsquo;s mind as to knowledge? The cross-examination makes out, that if the agent be supposed to
know, &mdash; then there is no man corresponding to the definition of a &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&#942;&sigmaf;: if the agent be supposed not to know &mdash; then, on
the contrary, every man will come under the definition. The Companion is persuaded that there is such a thing as &ldquo;love of gain&rdquo; in the blamable sense. Yet he cannot find any tenable
definition, to discriminate it from &ldquo;love of gain&rdquo; in the ordinary or innocent sense.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_24" id="Sidenotev2_14_24"></a> Admitting that there is bad gain, as well as good gain, what is the meaning of the word <i>gain</i>? None is
found.</span></p>

<p>The same question comes back in another form, after Sokrates has given the liberty of retractation. The Collocutor maintains that there is bad <i>gain</i>, as well as good <i>gain</i>. But what is
that common, generic, quality, designated well as good by the word <i>gain</i>, apart from these two distinctive epithets? He cannot find it out or describe it. He gives two definitions, each of
which is torn up by Sokrates. To deserve the name of <i>gain</i>, that which a man acquires must be good; and it must surpass, in value as well <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page84" id="v2page84">
</a>84</span>as in quantity, the loss or outlay which he incurs in order to acquire it. But when thus understood, all gains are good. There is no meaning in the distinction between good and bad
gains: all men are lovers of gain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_25" id="Sidenotev2_14_25"></a> Purpose of Plato in the dialogue &mdash; to lay bare the confusion, and to force the mind of the respondent into
efforts for clearing it up.</span></p>

<p>With this confusion, the dialogue closes. The Sokratic notion of <i>good</i>, as what every one loves &mdash; <i>evil</i> as what every one hates &mdash; also of evil-doing, as performed by every
evil-doer only through ignorance or mistake is brought out and applied to test the ethical phraseology of a common-place respondent. But it only serves to lay bare a state of confusion and
perplexity, without clearing up any thing. Herein, so far as I can see, lies Plato&rsquo;s purpose in the dialogue. The respondent is made aware of the confusion, which he did not know before; and
this, in Plato&rsquo;s view, is a progress. The respondent cannot avoid giving contradictory answers, under an acute cross-examination: but he does not adopt any new belief. He says to Sokrates at
the close &mdash; &ldquo;The debate has constrained rather than persuaded me&rdquo;.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_31" href="#Footnotev2_14_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> This is a simple but instructive
declaration of the force put by Sokrates upon his collocutors; and of the reactionary effort likely to be provoked in their minds, with a view to extricate themselves from a painful sense of
contradiction. If such effort be provoked, Plato&rsquo;s purpose is attained.</p>

<p>One peculiarity there is, analogous to what we have already seen in the Hippias Major. It is not merely the Collocutor who charges Sokrates, but also Sokrates who accuses the Collocutor &mdash;
each charging the other with attempts to deceive a friend.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_32" href="#Footnotev2_14_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> This seems intended by Plato to create an occasion for

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_26" id="Sidenotev2_14_26"></a> Historical narrative and comments given in the dialogue respecting Hipparchus &mdash; afford no ground for declaring
the dialogue to be spurious.</span></p>

<p>The modern critics, who proclaim the Hipparchus not to be the work of Plato, allege as one of the proofs of spuriousness, the occurrence of this long narrative and comment upon the historical
Hipparchus and his behaviour; which narrative (the critics maintain) Plato would never have introduced, seeing that it <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page85" id="v2page85"></a>85</span>contributes
nothing to the settlement of the question debated. But to this we may reply, first, That there are other dialogues<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_33" href="#Footnotev2_14_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a>
(not to mention the Minos) in which Plato introduces recitals of considerable length, historical or quasi-historical recitals; bearing remotely, or hardly bearing at all, upon the precise question
under discussion; next, &mdash; That even if no such analogies could be cited, and if the case stood single, no modern critic could fairly pretend to be so thoroughly acquainted with Plato&rsquo;s
views and the surrounding circumstances, as to put a limit on the means which Plato might choose to take, for rendering his dialogues acceptable and interesting. Plato&rsquo;s political views made
him disinclined to popular government generally, and to the democracy of Athens in particular. Conformably with such sentiment, he is disposed to surround the rule of the Peisistratid&aelig; with an
ethical and philosophical colouring: to depict Hipparchus as a wise man busied in instructing and elevating the citizens; and to discredit the renown of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, by affirming them
to have been envious of Hipparchus, as a philosopher who surpassed themselves by his own mental worth. All this lay perfectly in the vein of Plato&rsquo;s sentiment; and we may say the same about the
narrative in the Minos, respecting the divine parentage and teaching of Minos, giving rise to his superhuman efficacy as a lawgiver and ruler. It is surely very conceivable, that Plato, as a composer
of ethical dialogues or dramas, might think that such recitals lent a charm or interest to some of them. Moreover, something like variety, or distinctive features as between one dialogue and another,
was a point of no inconsiderable moment. I am of opinion that Plato did so conceive these narratives. But at any rate, what I here contend is, that no modern critics have a right to assume as certain
that he did not.</p>

leaving &mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&tau;&#8052;&sigmaf; in the text: we must undoubtedly suppose the author to have made an assertion historically erroneous: but this is nowise impossible in the case of
&AElig;lian. If you construe the passage as it stands, without such conjectural alteration, it does not justify Wolf&rsquo;s inference.</p>

property connoted by the word &nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; or law?</span></p>

<p>I now come to the Minos. The subject of this dialogue is, the explanation or definition of Law. Sokrates says to his Companion or Collocutor, &mdash; Tell me what is the generic constituent of
Law: All Laws are alike <i>quatenus</i> Law. Take no note of the difference between one law and another, but explain to me what characteristic property it is, which is common to all Law, and is
implied in or connoted by the name Law.</p>

<p>This question is logically the same as that which Sokrates asks in the Hipparchus with reference to &kappa;&#941;&rho;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf; or gain.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_28" id="Sidenotev2_14_28"></a> This question was discussed by the historical Sokrates, Memorabilia of Xenophon.</span></p>

<p>That the definition of &nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; or Law was discussed by Sokrates, we know, not only from the general description of his debates given in Xenophon, but also from the
interesting description (in that author) of the conversation between the youthful Alkibiades and Perikles.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_34" href="#Footnotev2_14_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> The
interrogations employed by Alkibiades on that occasion are Sokratic, and must have been derived, directly or indirectly, from Sokrates. They are partially analogous to the questions of Sokrates in
the dialogue Minos, and they end by driving Perikles into a confusion, left unexplained, between Law and Lawlessness.</p>

<p>Definitions of &nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; are here given by the Companion, who undergoes a cross-examination upon them. First, he says, that &Nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; = &tau;&#8048;
&nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;&zeta;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;. But this is rejected by Sokrates, who intimates that Law is not the aggregate of laws enacted or of customs held binding: but that which
lies behind these laws and customs, imparting to them their binding force.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_35" href="#Footnotev2_14_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> We are to enquire what this is. The
Companion declares that it is the public decree of the city: political or social opinion. But this again Sokrates contests: putting questions to show that Law includes, as a portion of its meaning,
justice, goodness, beauty, and preservation of the city with its possessions; while lawlessness includes injustice, evil, ugliness, and destruction. There can be no such thing as bad or wicked law.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_14_36" href="#Footnotev2_14_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> But among decrees of the city, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page87" id="v2page87"></a>87</span>some are bad, some
are good. Therefore to define Law as a decree of the city, thus generally, is incorrect. It is only the good decree, not the bad decree, which is Law. Now the good decree or opinion, is the true
opinion: that is, it is the finding out of reality. Law therefore wishes or aims to be the finding out of reality: and if there are differences between different nations, this is because the power to
find out does not always accompany the wish to find out.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_30" id="Sidenotev2_14_30"></a> Sokrates affirms that law is everywhere the same &mdash; it is the declared judgment and command of the Wise man upon
the subject to which it refers &mdash; it is truth and reality, found out and certified by him.</span></p>

<p>As to the assertion &mdash; that Law is one thing here, another thing there, one thing at one time, another thing at another &mdash; Sokrates contests it. Just things are just (he says) everywhere
and at all times; unjust things are unjust also. Heavy things are heavy, light things light, at one time, as well as at another. So also honourable things are everywhere honourable, base things
everywhere base. In general phrase, existent things are everywhere existent,<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_37" href="#Footnotev2_14_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> non-existent things are not existent.
Whoever therefore fails to attain the existent and real, fails to attain the lawful and just. It is only the man of art and knowledge, in this or that department, who attains the existent, the real,
the right, true, lawful, just. Thus the authoritative rescripts or laws in matters of medicine, are those laid down by practitioners who know that subject, all of whom agree in what they lay down:
the laws of cookery, the laws of agriculture and of gardening &mdash; are rescripts delivered by artists who know respectively each of those subjects. So also about Just and Unjust, about the
political and social arrangements of the city &mdash; the authoritative rescripts or laws are, those laid down by the artists or men of knowledge in that department, all of whom agree in laying down
the same: that is, all the men of art called kings or lawgivers. It is only the right, the true, the real &mdash; that which these artists attain &mdash; which is properly a law and is entitled to be
so called. That which is not right is not a law, &mdash; ought not to be so called &mdash; and is only supposed to be a law by the error of ignorant men.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_38" href=

Platonic. The Good, True, and Real, coalesce in the mind of Plato &mdash; he acknowledges nothing to be Law, except what he thinks ought to <i>be</i> Law.</span></p>

<p>That the reasoning of Sokrates in this dialogue is confused and unsound (as M. Boeckh and other critics have remarked), I perfectly agree. But it is not the less completely Platonic; resting upon
views and doctrines much cherished and often reproduced by Plato. The dialogue Minos presents, in a rude and awkward manner, without explanation or amplification, that worship of the Abstract and the
Ideal, which Plato, in other and longer dialogues, seeks to diversify as well as to elaborate. The definitions of Law here combated and given by Sokrates, illustrate this. The good, the true, the
right, the beautiful, the real &mdash; all coalesce in the mind of Plato. There is nothing (in his view) real, except <i>The</i> Good, <i>The</i> Just, &amp;c. (&tau;&#8056;
&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&omicron;-&#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#8056;&nu;; &alpha;&#8016;&tau;&omicron;-&delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &mdash; Absolute Goodness and Justice): particular
good and just things have no reality, they are no more good and just than bad and unjust &mdash; they are one or the other, according to circumstances &mdash; they are ever variable, floating midway
between the real and unreal.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_39" href="#Footnotev2_14_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> The real alone is knowable, correlating with knowledge or with the knowing Intelligence
&Nu;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf;. As Sokrates distinguishes elsewhere &tau;&#8056; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; or
&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&omicron;-&delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; from &tau;&#8048; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&alpha; &mdash; so here he distinguishes
(&nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; from &tau;&#8048; &nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;&zeta;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;) <i>Law</i>, from the assemblage of actual commands or customs received as <i>laws</i>
among mankind. These latter are variable according to time and place; but Law is always one and the same. Plato will acknowledge nothing to <i>be</i> Law, except that which (he thinks) <i>ought to
be</i> Law: that which emanates from a lawgiver of consummate knowledge, who aims at the accomplishment of the good and the real, and knows how to discover and realise that end. So far as &ldquo;the
decree of the city&rdquo; coincides with what would have been enacted by this lawgiver (<i>i. e.</i> so far as it is good and right), Sokrates admits it as a valid explanation of Law; but no farther.
He considers the phrase <i>bad law</i> to express a logical impossibility, involving a contradiction <i>in adjecto</i>.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_40" href="#Footnotev2_14_40"><span class=
"sp">40</span></a> What others call a bad law, he regards as being <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page89" id="v2page89"></a>89</span>no real law, but only a fallacious image, mistaken for such by
the ignorant. He does not consider such ignorant persons as qualified to judge: he recognises only the judgment of the knowing one or few, among whom he affirms that there can be no difference of
opinion. Every one admits just things to be just, &mdash; unjust things to be unjust, &mdash; heavy things to be heavy, &mdash; the existent and the real, to be the existent and the real. If then the
lawgiver in any of his laws fails to attain this reality, he fails in the very purpose essential to the conception of law:<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_41" href="#Footnotev2_14_41"><span class=

<p>The same argument is brought to bear by the Platonic Sokrates against Hippias in the Hippias Major, 284-285. If the laws are not really profitable, which is the only real purpose for which they
were established, they are no laws at all. The Spartans are &pi;&alpha;&rho;&#940;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&iota;. Some of the answers assigned to Hippias (284 D) are pertinent enough; but he is

<p>By <i>Law</i> then, Plato means &mdash; not the assemblage of actual positive rules, nor any general property common to and characteristic of them, nor the free determination of an assembled Demos
as distinguished from the mandates of a despot &mdash; but the Type of Law as it ought to be, and as it would be, if prescribed by a perfectly wise ruler, aiming at good and knowing how to realise
it. This, which is the ideal of his own mind, Plato worships and reasons upon as if it were the only reality; as Law by nature, or natural Law, distinguished from actual positive laws: which last
have either been set by some ill-qualified historical ruler, or have grown up insensibly. Knowledge, art, philosophy, systematic and constructive, applied by some one or few exalted individuals, is
(in his view) the only cause capable of producing that typical result which is true, good, real, permanent, and worthy of the generic name.</p>

Rectitude of Law, Government, Names, &amp;c.</span></p>

<p>In the Minos, this general Platonic view is applied to Law: in the Politikus, to government and social administration: in the Kratylus, to naming or language. In the Politikus, we find the
received classification of governments (monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy) discarded as improper; and the assertion advanced, That there is only one government right, true, genuine, really
existing &mdash; government by the uncontrolled authority and superintendence of the man of exalted intelligence: he who is master in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page90" id="v2page90">

"#Footnotev2_14_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> maintains that things can only be named according to their true and real nature &mdash; that there is, belonging to each thing, one special and
appropriate Name-Form, discernible only by the sagacity of the intelligent Lawgiver: who alone is competent to bestow upon each thing its right, true, genuine, real name, possessing rectitude by
nature (&#8000;&rho;&theta;&#972;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf; &phi;&#973;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;).<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_44" href="#Footnotev2_14_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> This Name-Form (according to

<p>The Kings of Sparta and Macedonia, the &Beta;&omicron;&upsilon;&lambda;&#8052; and &Delta;&#8134;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; of Athens, the Despot of Syracuse or Pher&aelig; are here declared to be not

gymnastic trainer prescribes proper measure of nourishment and exercise for their bodies? &mdash; the question is left unanswered. Sokrates confesses with shame that he cannot answer it: and the

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_14_36" id="Sidenotev2_14_36"></a> Explanations of the word Law &mdash; confusion in its meaning.</span></p>

<p>Whoever has followed the abstract of the Minos, which I have just given, will remark the different explanations of the word Law &mdash; both those which are disallowed, and that which is
preferred, though left incomplete, by Sokrates. On this same subject, there are in many writers, modern as well an ancient, two distinct modes of confusion traceable &mdash; pointed out by eminent
recent jurists, such as Mr. Bentham, Mr. Austin, and Mr. Maine. 1. Between Law as it is, and Law as it ought to be. 2. Between Laws Imperative, set by intelligent rulers, and enforced by penal
sanction &mdash; and Laws signifying uniformities of fact expressed in general terms, such as the Law of Gravitation, Crystallisation, &amp;c. &mdash; We can hardly say that in the dialogue Minos,
Plato falls into the first of these two modes of confusion: for he expressly says that he only recognises the Ideal of Law, or Law as it ought to be (actual Laws everywhere being disallowed, except
in so far as they conform thereunto). But he does fall into the second, when he identifies the Lawful with the Real or Existent. His Ideal stands in place of generalisations of fact.</p>

<p>There is also much confusion, if we compare the Minos with other dialogues; wherein Plato frequently talks of Laws as the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page92" id="v2page92"></a>92</span>laws
and customs actually existing or imperative in any given state &mdash; Athens, Sparta, or elsewhere (&Nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; = &tau;&#8048;
&nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;&zeta;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;, according to the first words in the Minos). For example, in the harangue which he supposes to be addressed to Sokrates in the Kriton, and
which he invests with so impressive a character &mdash; the Laws of Athens are introduced as speakers: but according to the principles laid down in the Minos, three-fourths of the Laws of Athens
could not be regarded as laws at all. If therefore we take Plato&rsquo;s writings throughout, we shall not find that he is constant to one uniform sense of the word Law, or that he escapes the
frequent confusion between Law as it actually exists and Law as it ought to be.<a name="FnAnchorv2_14_49" href="#Footnotev2_14_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a></p>

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_14_49" id="Footnotev2_14_49"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_14_49">49</a></span> The first explanation of &nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; advanced by
the Companion in reply to Sokrates (viz. &Nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; = &tau;&#8048; &nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;&zeta;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;, coincides substantially with the meaning of
&Nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; &beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8058;&sigmaf; in Pindar and Herodotus (see above, chap. viii.), who is an
imaginary ruler, occupying a given region, and enforcing &tau;&#8048; &nu;&omicron;&mu;&iota;&zeta;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;. It coincides also with the precept &Nu;&#972;&mu;&#8179;
&pi;&#972;&lambda;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;, as prescribed by the Pythian priestess to applicants who asked advice about the proper forms of religious worship (Xen. Mem. i. 3, 1); though this precept,
when Cicero comes to report it (Legg. ii. 16, 40), appears divested of its simplicity, and over-clouded with the very confusion touched upon in my text. Aristotle does not keep clear of the confusion
(compare Ethic. Nikom. i. 1, 1094, b. 16, and v. 5, 1130, b. 24). I shall revert again to the distinction between &nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; and &phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;, in touching on
other Platonic dialogues. Cicero expressly declares (Legg. ii. 5, 11), conformably to what is said by the Platonic Sokrates in the Minos, that a bad law, however passed in regular form, is no law at

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p>In continuing to recognise Hipparchus and Minos as Platonic works, contrary to the opinion of many modern critics, I have to remind the reader, not only that both are included in the Canon of
Thrasyllus, but that the Minos was expressly acknowledged by Aristophanes of Byzantium, and included by him among the Trilogies: showing that it existed then (220 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) in
the Alexandrine Museum as a Platonic work. The similarity between the Hipparchus and Minos is recognised by all the Platonic critics, most of whom declare that both of them are spurious.
Schleiermacher affirms and vindicates this opinion in his Einleitung and notes: but it will be convenient to take the arguments advanced to prove the spuriousness, as they are set forth by M. Boeckh,
in his &ldquo;Comment. in Platonis qui vulgo fertur Minoem&rdquo;: in which treatise, though among his early works, the case is argued with all that copious learning and critical ability, which
usually adorn his many admirable contributions to the improvement of philology.</p>

<p>M. Boeckh not only rejects the pretensions of Hipparchus and Minos to be considered as works of Plato, but advances an affirmative hypothesis to show what they are. He considers these two
dialogues, together with those De Justo, and De Virtute (two short dialogues in the pseudo-Platonic list, not recognised by Thrasyllus) as among the dialogues published by Simon; an Athenian citizen
and a shoemaker by trade, in whose shop Sokrates is said to have held many of his conversations. Simon is reported to have made many notes of these conversations, and to have composed and published,
from them, a volume of thirty-three dialogues (Diog. L. ii. 122), among the titles of which there are two &mdash; &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&Phi;&iota;&lambda;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf; and &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &Nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;. Simon was, of course, contemporary with Plato; but somewhat
older in years. With this part of M. Boeckh&rsquo;s treatise, respecting the supposed authorship of Simon, I have nothing to do. I only notice the arguments by which he proposes to show that
Hipparchus and Minos are not works of Plato.</p>

<p>In the first place, I notice that M. Boeckh explicitly recognises them <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page94" id="v2page94"></a>94</span>as works of an author contemporary with Plato, not later
than 380 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (p. 46). Hereby many of the tests, whereby we usually detect spurious works, become inapplicable.</p>

<p>In the second place, he admits that the dialogues are composed in good Attic Greek, suitable to the Platonic age both in character and manners &mdash; &ldquo;At veteris esse et Attici scriptoris,
probus sermo, antiqui mores, totus denique character, spondeat,&rdquo; p. 32.</p>

<p>The reasons urged by M. Boeckh to prove the spuriousness of the Minos, are first, that it is unlike Plato &mdash; next, that it is too much like Plato. &ldquo;Dupliciter dialogus a Platonis
ingenio discrepat: partim quod parum, partim quod nimium, similis ceteris ejusdem scriptis sit. Parum similis est in rebus permultis. Nam cum Plato adhuc vivos ac videntes aut nuper defunctos
notosque homines, ut scenicus poeta actores, moribus ingeniisque accurate descriptis, nominatim producat in medium &mdash; in isto opusculo cum Socrate colloquens persona plan&eacute; incerta est ac
nomine carens: quippe cum imperitus scriptor esset artis illius colloquiis suis <i>dulcissimas veneres</i> illas inferendi, qu&aelig; ex peculiaribus personarum moribus pingendis redundant, atque
&agrave; Platone ut flores per amplos dialogorum hortos sunt disseminat&aelig;&rdquo; (pp. 7-8): again, p. 9, it is complained that there is an &ldquo;infinitus secundarius collocutor&rdquo; in the
Hipparchus.</p>

<p>Now the sentence, just transcribed from M. Boeckh, shows that he had in his mind as standard of comparison, a certain number of the Platonic works, but that he did not take account of all of them.
The Platonic Protagoras begins with a dialogue between Sokrates and an unknown, nameless person; to whom Sokrates, after a page of conversation with him, recounts what has just passed between
himself, Protagoras, and others. Next, if we turn to the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus, we find that in both of them, not simply the secundarius collocutor, but even the principal speaker, is an
unknown and nameless person, described only as a Stranger from Elea, and never before seen by Sokrates. Again, in the Leges, the principal speaker is only an
&#7944;&theta;&eta;&nu;&alpha;&#8150;&omicron;&sigmaf; &xi;&#941;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;, without a name. In the face of such analogies, it is unsafe to lay down a peremptory rule, that no dialogue can
be the work of Plato, which acknowledges as <i>collocutor</i> an unnamed person.</p>

<p>Then again &mdash; when M. Boeckh complains that the Hipparchus and Minos are destitute of those &ldquo;<i>flores et dulcissim&aelig; Veneres</i>&rdquo; which Plato is accustomed to spread through
his dialogues &mdash; I ask, Where are the &ldquo;dulcissim&aelig; Veneres&rdquo; in the Parmenid&ecirc;s, Sophist&ecirc;s, Politikus, Leges, Tim&aelig;us, Kritias? I find none. The presence of
&ldquo;dulcissim&aelig; Veneres&rdquo; is not a condition <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>, in every composition which <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page95" id="v2page95"></a>95</span>pretends to Plato
as its author: nor can the absence of them be admitted as a reason for disallowing Hipparchus and Minos.</p>

<p>The analogy of the Sophist&ecirc;s and Politikus (besides Symposium, Republic, and Leges) farther shows, that there is nothing wonderful in finding the titles of Hipparchus and Minos derived from
the subjects (&Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &Phi;&iota;&lambda;&kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&delta;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf; and &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &Nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;), not from the name of
one of the collocutors:&mdash; whether we suppose the titles to have been bestowed by Plato himself, or by some subsequent editor (Boeckh, p. 10).</p>

<p>To illustrate his first ground of objection &mdash; Dissimilarity between the Minos and the true Platonic writings &mdash; M. Boeckh enumerates (pp. 12-23) several passages of the dialogue which
he considers unplatonic. Moreover, he includes among them (p. 12) examples of confused and illogical reasoning. I confess that to me this evidence is noway sufficient to prove that Plato is not the
author. That certain passages may be picked out which are obscure, confused, inelegant &mdash; is certainly no sufficient evidence. If I thought so, I should go along with Ast in rejecting the
Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Menon, Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s, Lysis, &amp;c., against all which Ast argues as spurious, upon evidence of the same kind. It is not too much to say, that against almost every
one of the dialogues, taken severally, a case of the same kind, more or less plausible, might be made out. You might in each of them find passages peculiar, careless, awkwardly expressed. The
expression &tau;&#8052;&nu; &#7936;&nu;&theta;&rho;&omega;&pi;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;&nu; &#7936;&gamma;&#941;&lambda;&eta;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; &sigma;&#974;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
which M. Boeckh insists upon so much as improper, would probably have been considered as a mere case of faulty text, if it had occurred in any other dialogue: and so it may fairly be considered in
the Minos.</p>

<p>Moreover as to faults of logic and consistency in the reasoning, most certainly these cannot be held as proving the Minos not to be Plato&rsquo;s work. I would engage to produce, from most of his
dialogues, defects of reasoning quite as grave as any which the Minos exhibits. On the principle assumed by M. Boeckh, every one who agreed with Pan&aelig;tius in considering the elaborate proof
given in the Ph&aelig;don, of the immortality of the soul, as illogical and delusive &mdash; would also agree with Pan&aelig;tius in declaring that the Ph&aelig;don was not the work of Plato. It is
one question, whether the reasoning in any dialogue be good or bad: it is another question, whether the dialogue be written by Plato or not. Unfortunately, the Platonic critics often treat the first
question as if it determined the second.</p>

<p>M. Boeckh himself considers that the evidence arising from dissimilarity (upon which I have just dwelt) is not the strongest part of his case. He relies more upon the evidence arising from <i>too
much similarity</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page96" id="v2page96"></a>96</span> as proving still more clearly the spuriousness of the Minos. &ldquo;Jam pergamus ad alteram partem
nostr&aelig; argumentationis, <i>eamque etiam firmiorem</i>, de <i>nimia similitudine</i> Platonicorum aliquot locorum, qu&aelig; imitationem doceat subesse. Nam de hoc quidem conveniet inter omnes
doctos et indoctos, Platonem se ipsum haud posse imitari: nisi si quis dubitet de san&acirc; ejus mente&rdquo; (p. 23). Again, p. 26, &ldquo;Jam vero in nostro colloquio Symposium, Politicum,
Euthyphronem, Protagoram, Gorgiam, Cratylum, Phil&ecirc;bum, dialogos expressos ac tantum non compilatos reperies&rdquo;. And M. Boeckh goes on to specify various passages of the Minos, which he
considers to have been imitated, and badly imitated, from one or other of these dialogues.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with M. Boeckh in regarding this <i>nimia similitudo</i> as the strongest part of his case. On the contrary, I consider it as the weakest: because his own premisses (in my judgment)
not only do not prove his conclusion, but go far to prove the opposite. When we find him insisting, in such strong language, upon the great analogy which subsists between the Minos and seven of the
incontestable Platonic dialogues, this is surely a fair proof that its author is the same as their author. To me it appears as conclusive as internal evidence ever can be; unless there be some
disproof <i>aliunde</i> to overthrow it. But M. Boeckh produces no such disproof. He converts these analogies into testimony in his own favour, simply by bestowing upon them the name <i>imitatio,
&mdash; stulta imitatio</i> (p. 27). This word involves an hypothesis, whereby the point to be proved is assumed &mdash; viz.: difference of authorship. &ldquo;Plato cannot have imitated
himself&rdquo; (M. Boeckh observes). I cannot admit such impossibility, even if you describe the fact in that phrase: but if you say &ldquo;Plato in one dialogue thought and wrote like Plato in
another&rdquo; &mdash; you describe the same fact in a different phrase, and it then appears not merely possible but natural and probable. Those very real analogies, to which M. Boeckh points in the
word <i>imitatio</i>, are in my judgment cases of the Platonic thought in one dialogue being like the Platonic thought in another. The <i>similitudo</i>, between Minos and these other dialogues, can
hardly be called <i>nimia</i>, for M. Boeckh himself points out that it is accompanied with much difference. It is a similitude, such as we should expect between one Platonic dialogue and another:
with this difference, that whereas, in the Minos, Plato gives the same general views in a manner more brief, crude, abrupt &mdash; in the other dialogues he works them out with greater fulness of
explanation and illustration, and some degree of change not unimportant. That there should be this amount of difference between one dialogue of Plato and another appears to me perfectly natural. On
the other hand &mdash; that there should have been a <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page97" id="v2page97"></a>97</span>contemporary <i>falsarius</i> (scriptor miser, insulsus, vilissimus, to use
phrases of M. Boeckh), who studied and pillaged the best dialogues of Plato, for the purpose of putting together a short and perverted abbreviation of them &mdash; and who contrived to get his
miserable abbreviation recognised by the Byzantine Aristophanes among the genuine dialogues notwithstanding the existence of the Platonic school &mdash; this, I think highly improbable.</p>

<p>I cannot therefore agree with M. Boeckh in thinking, that &ldquo;ubique se prodens Platonis imitatio&rdquo; (p. 31) is an irresistible proof of spuriousness: nor can I think that his hypothesis
shows itself to advantage, when he says, p. 10 &mdash; &ldquo;Ipse autem dialogus (Minos) quum post Politicum compositus sit, quod qu&aelig;dam in eo dicta rebus ibi expositis manifest&eacute;
nitantur, ut paullo post ostendemus &mdash; quis est qui artificiosissimum philosophum, postquam ibi (in Politico) accuratius de natur&acirc; legis egisset, de e&acirc; iterum putet negligenter
egisse?&rdquo; &mdash; I do not think it so impossible as it appears to M. Boeckh, that a philosopher, after having <i>written</i> upon a given subject <i>accuratius</i>, should subsequently write
upon it <i>negligenter</i>. But if I granted this ever so fully, I should still contend that there remains another alternative. The negligent workmanship may have preceded the accurate: an
alternative which I think is probably the truth, and which has nothing to exclude it except M. Boeckh&rsquo;s pure hypothesis, that the Minos must have been copied from the Politikus.</p>

<p>While I admit then that the Hipparchus and Minos are among the inferior and earlier compositions of Plato, I still contend that there is no ground for excluding them from the list of his works.
Though the Platonic critics of this century are for the most part of an adverse opinion, I have with me the general authority of the critics anterior to this century &mdash; from Aristophanes of
Byzantium down to Bentley and Ruhnken &mdash; see Boeckh, pp. 7-32.</p>

sufficient.</span></p>

<p>This is among the dialogues declared by Schleiermacher, Ast, Stallbaum, and various other modern critics, to be spurious and unworthy of Plato: the production of one who was not merely an
imitator, but a bad and silly imitator.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_1" href="#Footnotev2_15_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Socher on the other hand defends the dialogue against them, reckoning it as a
juvenile production of Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_2" href="#Footnotev2_15_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The arguments which are adduced to prove its spuriousness appear to me altogether
insufficient. It has some features of dissimilarity with that which we read in other dialogues &mdash; these the above-mentioned critics call un-Platonic: it has other features of similarity &mdash;
these they call bad imitation by a <i>falsarius</i>: lastly, it is inferior, as a performance, to the best of the Platonic dialogues. But I am prepared to expect (and have even the authority of
Schleiermacher for expecting) that some dialogues will be inferior to others. I also reckon with certainty, that between two dialogues, both genuine, there will be points of similarity as well as
points of dissimilarity. Lastly, the critics find marks of a bad, recent, un-Platonic style: but Dionysius of Halikarnassus &mdash; a judge at least equally competent upon such a matter &mdash; found
no such marks. He expressly cites the dialogue as the work of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page99" id="v2page99"></a>99</span>Plato,<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_3" href="#Footnotev2_15_3"><span class=

<p>In general, in discussions on the genuineness of any of the Platonic dialogues, I can do nothing but reply to the arguments of those critics who consider them spurious. But in the case of the
Theag&ecirc;s there is one argument which tends to mark Plato positively as the author.</p>

<p>In the Theag&ecirc;s, p. 125, the senarius &sigma;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&#8054; &tau;&#973;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&nu;&omicron;&iota; &tau;&#8182;&nu; &sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#8182;&nu;
&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&#943;&#8115; is cited as a verse of <i>Euripides</i>. Now it appears that this is an error of memory, and that the verse really belongs to <i>
Sophokles</i>, &#7952;&nu; &Alpha;&#7988;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota; &Lambda;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&#8183;. If the error had only appeared in this dialogue, Stallbaum would probably have cited it as one
more instance of stupidity on the part of the <i>ineptus tenebrio</i> whom he supposes to have written the dialogue. But unfortunately the error does not belong to the Theag&ecirc;s alone. It is
found also in the Republic (viii. 568 B), the most unquestionable of all the Platonic compositions. Accordingly, Schleiermacher tells us in his note that the <i>falsarius</i> of the Theag&ecirc;s has
copied this error out of the above-named passage of the Republic of Plato (notes, p. 500).</p>

<p>This last supposition of Schleiermacher appears to me highly improbable. Since we know that the mistake is one made by Plato himself, surely we ought rather to believe that he made it in two
distinct compositions. In other words, the occurrence of the same exact mistake in the Republic and the Theag&ecirc;s affords strong presumption that both are by the same author &mdash; Plato.</p>

<p>Demodokus, an elderly man (of rank and landed property), and his youthful son Theag&ecirc;s, have come from their Deme to Athens, and enter into conversation with Sokrates: to whom the father
explains, that Theag&ecirc;s has contracted, from the conversation of youthful companions, an extraordinary ardour for the acquisition of wisdom. The son has importuned his father to put him under
the tuition of one of the Sophists, who profess to teach wisdom. The father, though not unwilling to comply with the request, is deterred by the difficulty of finding a good teacher and avoiding a
bad one. He entreats the advice of Sokrates, who invites the young man to explain what it is that he wants, over and above the usual education of an Athenian youth of good family (letters, the harp,

the prolixity of the inductive process in this dialogue, and the multitude of examples here accumulated to prove a general proposition obvious enough without proof. Let us grant this to be true; we
cannot infer from it that the dialogue is not the work of Plato. By very similar arguments Socher endeavours to show that the Sophist&ecirc;s and the Politikus are not works of Plato, because in both
these dialogues logical division and differentiation is accumulated with tiresome prolixity, and applied to most trivial subjects. But Plato himself (in Politikus, pp. 285-286) explains why he does
so, and tells us that he wishes to familiarise his readers with logical subdivision and classification as a process. In like manner I maintain that prolixity in the
&lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&iota; &#7952;&pi;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&#943; is not to be held as proof of spurious authorship, any more than prolixity in the process of logical

I might yearn (says Theag&ecirc;s) for such despotic power over all: so probably would you and every other man. But it is not <i>that</i> to which I now aspire. I aspire to govern freemen, with their

(Lach&ecirc;s, 181 A); compare also Lysis, 211 A.</p>

<p>Demodokus joins his entreaties with those of Theag&ecirc;s to prevail upon Sokrates to undertake this function. But Sokrates in reply says that he is less fit for it than Demodokus himself, who
has exercised high political duties, with the esteem of every one; and that if practical statesmen are considered unfit, there are the professional Sophists, Prodikus, Gorgias, Polus, who teach many
pupils, and earn not merely good pay, but also the admiration and gratitude of every one &mdash; of the pupils as well as their senior relatives.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_10" href=

"#Footnotev2_15_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Towards many, it is positively adverse; so that I cannot even enter into companionship with them. Towards others, it does not forbid, yet neither
does it co-operate: so that they derive no benefit from me. There are others again in whose case it co-operates; these are the persons to whom you allude, who make rapid progress.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_15_16" href="#Footnotev2_15_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> With some, such improvement is lasting: others, though they improve wonderfully while in my society, yet relapse into
commonplace men when they leave me. Aristeides, for example (grandson of Aristeides the Just), was one of those who made rapid progress while he was with me. But he was forced to absent himself on
military service; and on returning, he found as my companion Thucydides (son of Melesias), who however had quarrelled with me for some debate of the day before. I understand (said Aristeides to me)
that Thucydides has taken offence and gives himself airs; he forgets what a poor creature he was, before he came to you.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_17" href="#Footnotev2_15_17"><span class=

one and make a good figure, so that I courted debate with the most accomplished men. Now, on the contrary, I avoid them altogether &mdash; so thoroughly am I ashamed of my own incapacity. Did the
capacity (I, <i>Sokrates</i>, asked Aristeides) forsake you all at once, or little by little? Little by little, he replied. And when you possessed it (I asked), did you get it by learning from me? or
in what other way? I will tell you, Sokrates (he answered), what seems incredible, yet is nevertheless true.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_18" href="#Footnotev2_15_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> I never
learnt from you any thing at all. You yourself well know this. But I always made progress, whenever I was along with you, even if I were only in the same house without being in the same room; but I
made greater progress, if I was in the same room &mdash; greater still, if I looked in your face, instead of turning my eyes elsewhere &mdash; and the greatest of all, by far, if I sat close and
touching you. But now (continued Aristeides) all that I then acquired has dribbled out of me.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_19" href="#Footnotev2_15_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a></p>

with the Lach&ecirc;s.</span></p>

<p>The Theag&ecirc;s figured in the list of Thrasyllus as first in the fifth Tetralogy: the other three members of the same Tetralogy being Charmid&ecirc;s, Lach&ecirc;s, Lysis. Some persons
considered it suitable to read as first dialogue of all.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_22" href="#Footnotev2_15_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> There are several points of analogy between the
Theag&ecirc;s and the Lach&ecirc;s, though with a different turn given to them. Aristeides and Thucydides are mentioned in both of them: Sokrates also is solicited to undertake the duty of teacher.
The ardour of the young Theag&ecirc;s to acquire wisdom reminds us of Hippokrates at the beginning of the Protagoras. The string of questions put by Sokrates to Theag&ecirc;s, requiring that what is
called wisdom shall be clearly defined and specialised, has its parallel in many of the Platonic dialogues. Moreover the declaration of Sokrates, that he knows nothing except about matters of love,
but that in them he is a consummate master &mdash; is the same as what he explicitly declares both in the Symposion and other dialogues.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_23" href="#Footnotev2_15_23"><span

<p>But the chief peculiarity of the Theag&ecirc;s consists in the stress which is laid upon the D&aelig;mon, the divine voice, the inspiration of Sokrates. This divine auxiliary is here described,
not only as giving a timely check or warning to Sokrates, when either he or his friends contemplated any inauspicious project &mdash; but also as intervening, in the case of those youthful companions
with whom he conversed, to promote the improvement of one, to obstruct that of others; so that whether Sokrates will produce any effect or not in improving any one, depends neither upon his own
efforts nor upon those of the recipient, but upon the unpredictable concurrence of a divine agency.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_24" href="#Footnotev2_15_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_15_12" id="Sidenotev2_15_12"></a> Plato employs this divine sign here to render some explanation of the singularity and eccentricity of Sokrates, and of
his unequal influence upon different companions.</span></p>

<p>Plato employs the Sokratic D&aelig;mon, in the Theag&ecirc;s, for a philosophical purpose, which, I think, admits of reasonable explanation. During the eight (perhaps ten) years of his personal
communion with Sokrates, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page105" id="v2page105"></a>105</span>he had had large experience of the variable and unaccountable effect produced by the Sokratic
conversation upon different hearers: a fact which is also attested by the Xenophontic Memorabilia. This difference of effect was in no way commensurate to the unequal intelligence of the hearers.
Ch&aelig;rephon, Apollod&ocirc;rus, Kriton, seem to have been ordinary men:&mdash;<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_25" href="#Footnotev2_15_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> while Kritias and Alkibiades, who
brought so much discredit both upon Sokrates and his teaching, profited little by him, though they were among the ablest pupils that he ever addressed: moreover Antisthenes, and Aristippus, probably
did not appear to Plato (since he greatly dissented from their philosophical views) to have profited much by the common companionship with Sokrates. Other companions there must have been also
personally known to Plato, though not to us: for we must remember that Sokrates passed his whole day in talking with all listeners. Now when Plato in after life came to cast the ministry of Sokrates
into dramatic scenes, and to make each scene subservient to the illustration of some philosophical point of view, at least a negative &mdash; he was naturally led to advert to the D&aelig;mon or
divine inspiration, which formed so marked a feature in the character of his master. The concurrence or prohibition of this divine auxiliary served to explain why it was that the seed, sown broadcast
by Sokrates, sometimes fructified, and sometimes did not fructify, or speedily perished afterwards &mdash; when no sufficient explanatory peculiarity could be pointed out in the ground on which it
fell. It gave an apparent reason for the perfect singularity of the course pursued by Sokrates: for his preternatural acuteness in one direction, and his avowed incapacity in another: for his mastery
of the Elenchus, convicting men of ignorance, and his inability to supply them with knowledge: for his refusal to undertake the duties of a teacher. All these are mysterious features of the Sokratic
character. The intervention of the D&aelig;mon appears to afford an explanation, by converting them into religious mysteries: which, though it be no explanation at all, yet is equally efficacious by
stopping the mouth of the questioner, and by making him believe that it is guilt and impiety to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page106" id="v2page106"></a>106</span>ask for explanation &mdash; as
Sokrates himself declared in regard to astronomical phenomena, and as Herodotus feels, when his narrative is crossed by strange religious legends.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_26" href=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_15_13" id="Sidenotev2_15_13"></a> Sokrates, while continually finding fault with other teachers, refused to teach himself &mdash; difficulty of finding
an excuse for his refusal. The Theag&ecirc;s furnishes an excuse.</span></p>

<p>In this manner, the Theag&ecirc;s is made by Plato to exhibit one way of parrying the difficulty frequently addressed to Sokrates by various hearers: &ldquo;You tell us that the leading citizens
cannot even teach their own sons, and that the Sophists teach nothing worth having: you perpetually call upon us to seek for better teachers, without telling us where such are to be found. We entreat
you to teach us yourself, conformably to your own views.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If a leader of political opposition, after years employed in denouncing successive administrators as ignorant and iniquitous, refuses, when invited, to take upon himself the business of
administration &mdash; an intelligent admirer must find some decent pretence to colour the refusal. Such a pretence is found for Sokrates in the Theag&ecirc;s: &ldquo;I am not my own master on this
point. I am the instrument of a divine ally, without whose active working I can accomplish nothing: who forbids altogether my teaching of one man &mdash; tolerates, without assisting, my unavailing
lessons to another &mdash; assists efficaciously in my teaching of a third, in which case alone the pupil receives any real benefit. The assistance of this divine ally is given or withheld according
to motives of his own, which I cannot even foretell, much less influence. I should deceive you therefore if I undertook to teach, when I cannot tell whether I shall do good or harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reply of Theag&ecirc;s meets this scruple. He asks permission to make the experiment, and promises to propitiate the divine auxiliary by prayer and sacrifice; under which reserve Sokrates
gives consent.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_15_14" id="Sidenotev2_15_14"></a> Plato does not always, nor in other dialogues, allude to the divine sign in the same way. Its character and working
essentially impenetrable. Sokrates a privileged person.</span></p>

<p>It is in this way that the D&aelig;mon or divine auxiliary serves the purpose of reconciling what would otherwise be an inconsistency in the proceedings of Sokrates. I mean, that such is the
purpose served in <i>this</i> dialogue: I know perfectly that Plato deals with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page107" id="v2page107"></a>107</span>case differently elsewhere: but I am not
bound (as I have said more than once) to force upon all the dialogues one and the same point of view. That the agency of the Gods was often and in the most important cases, essentially undiscoverable
and unpredictable, and that in such cases they might sometimes be prevailed on to give special warnings to favoured persons &mdash; were doctrines which the historical Sokrates in Xenophon asserts
with emphasis.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_27" href="#Footnotev2_15_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> The D&aelig;mon of Sokrates was believed, both by himself and his friends, to be a special privilege
and an extreme case of divine favour and communication to him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_28" href="#Footnotev2_15_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> It was perfectly applicable to the scope of the
Theag&ecirc;s, though Plato might not choose always to make the same employment of it. It is used in the same general way in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus;<a name="FnAnchorv2_15_29" href=
"#Footnotev2_15_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> doubtless with less expansion, and blended with another analogy (that of the mid-wife) which introduces a considerable difference.<a name=

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>&Tau;&#8056; &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;.</h3>

<p>Here is one of the points most insisted on by Schleiermacher and Stallbaum, as proving that the Theag&ecirc;s is not the work of Plato. These critics affirm (to use the language of Stallbaum,
Proleg. p. 220) &ldquo;Quam Plato alias de Socratis d&aelig;monio prodidit sententiam, ea longissim&egrave; recedit ab ill&acirc; ratione, qu&aelig; in hoc sermone exposita est&rdquo;. He says that
the representation of the D&aelig;mon of Sokrates, given in the Theag&ecirc;s, has been copied from a passage in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, by an imitator who has not understood the passage, p. 150,
D, E. But Socher (p. 97) appears to me to have shown satisfactorily, that there is no such material difference as these critics affirm between this passage of the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and the
Theag&ecirc;s. In the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Sokrates declares, that none of his companions learnt any thing from him, but that all of them &omicron;&#7991;&sigma;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; &#7938;&nu;
&#8001; &theta;&epsilon;&#8056;&sigmaf; &pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&#943;&kappa;&#8131; (the very same term is used at the close of the Theag&ecirc;s &mdash; 131 A, &#7952;&#8048;&nu; &mu;&#8050;&nu;
&pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&#943;&kappa;&#8131; &#7969;&mu;&#8150;&nu; &mdash; &tau;&#8056; &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu;) made astonishing progress and improvement in his
company. Stallbaum says, &ldquo;Itaque &#8001; &theta;&epsilon;&#8056;&sigmaf;, qui ibi memoratur, non est Socratis d&aelig;monium, sed potius deus <i>i.e.</i> sors divina. Quod non perspiciens <i>
noster tenebrio</i> protenus illud d&aelig;monium, quod Socrates sibi semper adesse dictitabat, ad eum dignitatis et potenti&aelig; gradum evexit, ut, &amp;c.&rdquo; I agree with Socher in thinking
that the phrase &#8001; &theta;&epsilon;&#8056;&sigmaf; in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus has substantially the same meaning as &tau;&#8056; &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; in the
Theag&ecirc;s. Both Schleiermacher (Notes on the Apology, p. 432) and Ast (p. 482), have notes on the phrase &tau;&#8056; &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &mdash; and I think the
note of Ast is the more instructive of the two. In Plato and Xenophon, the words &tau;&#8056; &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu;, &tau;&#8056; &theta;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;,
are in many cases undistinguishable in meaning from &#8001; &delta;&alpha;&#943;&mu;&omega;&nu;, &#8001; &theta;&epsilon;&#972;&sigmaf;. Compare the Ph&aelig;drus, 242 E, about
&theta;&epsilon;&#8056;&sigmaf; and &theta;&epsilon;&#8150;&#972;&nu; &tau;&iota;. Sokrates, in his argument against Meletus in the Apology (p. 27) emphatically argues that no man could believe in
any thing &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu;, without also believing in &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;. The special &theta;&epsilon;&#8150;&#972;&nu;
&tau;&iota; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page109" id="v2page109"></a>109</span>&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; (Apol. p. 31 C), which presented itself
in regard to him and his proceedings, was only one of the many modes in which (as he believed) &#8001; &theta;&epsilon;&#972;&sigmaf; commanded and stimulated him to work upon the minds of the
Athenians:&mdash; &#7952;&mu;&omicron;&#8054; &delta;&#8050; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;&tau;&omicron;, &#8033;&sigmaf; &#7952;&gamma;&#974; &phi;&eta;&mu;&iota;,
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&#941;&tau;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&alpha;&iota; &#8017;&pi;&#8056; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8166; &pi;&rho;&#940;&tau;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7952;&kappa; &mu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&#8182;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7952;&xi; &#7952;&nu;&upsilon;&pi;&nu;&#943;&omega;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&pi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#8054; &tau;&rho;&#972;&pi;&#8179;, &#8103;&pi;&#941;&rho; &tau;&#943;&sigmaf; &pi;&omicron;&tau;&epsilon; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7940;&lambda;&lambda;&eta;
&theta;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha; &mu;&omicron;&#8150;&rho;&alpha; &#7936;&nu;&theta;&rho;&#974;&pi;&#8179; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#8001;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&#8166;&nu;
&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#941;&tau;&alpha;&xi;&epsilon; &pi;&rho;&#940;&tau;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; (Apol. p. 33 C). So again in Apol. p. 40 A, B, &#7969;
&epsilon;&#7984;&omega;&theta;&upsilon;&#8150;&#940; &mu;&omicron;&iota; &mu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8052; &#7969; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&#943;&omicron;&upsilon; &mdash; and four lines afterwards we read the very same fact intimated in the words, &tau;&#8056; &tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8166; &sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;, where Sokratis d&aelig;monium &mdash; and Deus &mdash; are identified: thus refuting the argument above cited from
Stallbaum. There is therefore no such discrepancy, in reference to &tau;&#8056; &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu;, as Stallbaum and Schleiermacher contend for. We perceive indeed
this difference between them &mdash; that in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, the simile of the obstetric art is largely employed, while it is not noticed in the Theag&ecirc;s. But we should impose an
unwarrantable restriction upon Plato&rsquo;s fancy, if we hindered him from working out his variety and exuberance of metaphors, and from accommodating each dialogue to the metaphor predominant with
him at the time.</p>

<p>Moreover, in respect to what is called the D&aelig;mon of Sokrates, we ought hardly to expect that either Plato or Xenophon would always be consistent even with themselves. It is unsafe for a
modern critic to determine beforehand, by reason or feelings of his own, in what manner either of them would speak upon this mysterious subject. The belief and feeling of a divine intervention was
very real on the part of both, but their manner of conceiving it might naturally fluctuate: and there was, throughout all the proceedings of Sokrates, a mixture of the serious and the playful, of the
sublime and the eccentric, of ratiocinative acuteness with impulsive superstition &mdash; which it is difficult to bring into harmonious interpretation. Such heterogeneous mixture is forcibly
described in the Platonic Symposium, pp. 215-222. When we consider how undefined, and undefinable, the idea of this &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; was, we cannot wonder if
Plato ascribes to it different workings and manifestations at different times. Stallbaum affirms that it is made ridiculous in the Theag&ecirc;s: and K&uuml;hner declares that Plutarch makes it
ridiculous, in his treatise De Genio Sokratia (Comm. ad. Xenoph. Memor. p. 23). But this is because its agency is described more in detail. You can easily present it in a ridiculous aspect, by
introducing it as intervening on petty and insignificant matters. Now it is remarkable, that in the Apology, we are expressly told that it actually did intervene on the most trifling occasions
&mdash; &pi;&#940;&nu;&upsilon; <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page110" id="v2page110"></a>110</span>&#7952;&pi;&#8054; &sigma;&mu;&iota;&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf;
&#7952;&nu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&omicron;&upsilon;&mu;&#941;&nu;&eta;. The business of an historian of philosophy is, to describe it as it was really felt and believed by Sokrates and Plato &mdash;
whether a modern critic may consider the description ridiculous or not.</p>

<p>When Schleiermacher says (Einleitung, p. 248), respecting the <i>falsarius</i> whom he supposes to have written the Theag&ecirc;s &mdash; &ldquo;Damit ist ihm begegnet, auf eine h&ouml;chst
verkehrte Art wunderbar zusammenzur&uuml;hren diese g&ouml;ttliche Schickung, und jenes pers&ouml;nliche Vorgef&uuml;hl welches dem Sokrates zur g&ouml;ttlichen Stimme ward&rdquo;. &mdash; I contend
that the mistake is chargeable to Schleiermacher himself, for bisecting into two phenomena that which appears in the Apology as the same phenomenon under two different names &mdash; &tau;&#8056;
&delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; &mdash; &tau;&#8056; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; &theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8166; &sigma;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;. Besides, to treat the
D&aelig;mon as a mere &ldquo;personal presentiment&rdquo; of Sokrates, may be a true view:&mdash; but it is the view of one who does not inhale the same religious atmosphere as Sokrates, Plato, and
Xenophon. It cannot therefore be properly applied in explaining their sayings or doings. K&uuml;hner, who treats the Theag&ecirc;s as not composed by Plato, grounds this belief partly on the
assertion, that the &delta;&alpha;&iota;&mu;&#972;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&nu; of Sokrates is described therein as something peculiar to Sokrates; which, according to K&uuml;hner, was the fiction of a
subsequent time. By Sokrates and his contemporaries (K&uuml;hner says) it was considered &ldquo;non sibi soli tanquam proprium quoddam beneficium a Diis tributum, sed commune sibi esse cum
c&aelig;teris hominibus&rdquo; (pp. 20-21). I dissent entirely from this view, which is contradicted by most of the passages noticed even by K&uuml;hner himself. It is at variance with the Platonic
Apology, as well as with the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (150 D), and Republic (vi. 496 C). Xenophon does indeed try, in the first Chapter of the Memorabilia, as the defender of Sokrates, to soften the <i>
invidia</i> against Sokrates, by intimating that other persons had communications from the Gods as well as he. But we see plainly, even from other passages of the Memorabilia, that this was not the
persuasion of Sokrates himself, nor of his friends, nor of his enemies. They all considered it (as it is depicted in the Theag&ecirc;s also) to be a special privilege and revelation.</p>

pal&aelig;stra.</span></p>

<p>Instead of the simple, naked, self-introducing, conversation, which we read in the Menon, Hipparchus, Minos, &amp;c. Sokrates recounts a scene and colloquy, which occurred when he went into the
house of Dionysius the grammatist or school-master,<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_1" href="#Footnotev2_16_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> frequented by many elegant and high-born youths as pupils. Two of
these youths were engaged in animated debate upon some geometrical or astronomical problem, in the presence of various spectators; and especially of two young men, rivals for the affection of one of

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_16_5" id="Sidenotev2_16_5"></a> No answer given. What is the best conjecture? Answer of the literary Erastes. A man must learn that which will yield to
him the greatest reputation as a philosopher &mdash; as much as will enable him to talk like an intelligent critic, though not to practise.</span></p>

<p>The question is one which none of the persons present can answer.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_10" href="#Footnotev2_16_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> None of them can tell who is the special
referee, about training of mind; corresponding to the physician or the farmer in the analogous cases. Sokrates then puts a question somewhat different: <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Since we have agreed, that
the man who prosecutes philosophy ought not to learn many things, still less all things &mdash; what is the best conjecture that we can make, respecting the matters which he ought to learn? <i>
Erast.</i> &mdash; The finest and most suitable acquirements for him to aim at, are those which will yield to him the greatest reputation as a philosopher. He ought to appear accomplished in every
variety of science, or at least in all the more important; and with that view, to learn as much of each as becomes a freeman to know:&mdash; that is, what belongs to the intelligent critic, as
distinguished from the manual operative: to the planning and superintending architect, as distinguished from the working carpenter.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_11" href="#Footnotev2_16_11"><span class=

philosopher can be supposed to know each of them accurately, like the artist himself &mdash; but only as much as may be expected from the free and cultivated citizen. That is, he shall be able to
appreciate, better than other hearers, the observations made by the artist: and farther to deliver a reasonable opinion of his own, so as to be accounted, by all the hearers, more accomplished in the

call in the second-best man when he can have the regular practitioner.</span></p>

<p>Upon this answer Sokrates proceeds to cross-examine: <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do you think that good men are useful, bad men useless? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; Yes I do. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You think
that philosophers, as you describe them, are useful? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; Certainly: extremely useful. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But tell me on what occasions such second-best men are useful: for
obviously they are inferior to each separate artist. If you fall sick will you send for one of <i>them</i>, or for a professional physician? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; I should send for both. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; That is no answer: I wish to know, which of the two you will send for first and by preference? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; No doubt I shall send for the professional physician. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash;
The like also, if you are in danger on shipboard, you will entrust your life to the pilot rather than to the philosopher: and so as to all other matters, as long as a professional man is to be found,
the philosopher is of no use? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; So it appears. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Our philosopher then is one of the useless persons: for we assuredly have professional men at hand. Now we
agreed before, that good men were useful, bad men useless.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_15" href="#Footnotev2_16_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; Yes; that was agreed.</p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If then you have correctly defined a philosopher to be one who has a second-rate knowledge on many subjects, he is useless so long as there exist professional artists on each
subject. Your definition cannot therefore be correct. Philosophy must be something quite apart from this multifarious and busy meddling with <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page115" id="v2page115">

<p>Let us now, however (continues Sokrates), take up the matter in another way. In regard to horses and dogs, those who punish rightly are also those who know how to make them better, and to
discriminate with most exactness the good from the bad? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; Yes: such is the fact.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_16_9" id="Sidenotev2_16_9"></a> Sokrates changes his course of examination &mdash; questions put to show that there is one special art, regal and
political, of administering and discriminating the bad from the good.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Is not the case similar with men? Is it not the same art, which punishes men rightly, makes them better, and best distinguishes the good from the bad? whether applied to one,
few, or many? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; It is so.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_17" href="#Footnotev2_16_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The art or science, whereby men punish evil-doers
rightly, is the judicial or justice: and it is by the same that they know the good apart from the bad, either one or many. If any man be a stranger to this art, so as not to know good men apart from
bad, is he not also ignorant of himself, whether he be a good or a bad man? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; Yes: he is. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; To be ignorant of yourself, is to be wanting in sobriety or
temperance; to know yourself is to be sober or temperate. But this is the same art as that by which we punish rightly &mdash; or justice. Therefore justice and temperance are the same: and the
Delphian rescript, <i>Know thyself</i>, does in fact enjoin the practice both of justice and of sobriety.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_18" href="#Footnotev2_16_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> <i>
Erast.</i> &mdash; So it appears. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now it is by this same art, when practised by a king, rightly punishing evil-doers, that cities are well governed; it is by the same art
practised by a private citizen or house-master, that the house is well-governed: so that this art, justice or sobriety, is at the same time political, regal, economical; and the just and sober man is
at once the true king, statesman, house-master.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_19" href="#Footnotev2_16_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; I admit it.</p>

to be able to follow what he said <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page116" id="v2page116"></a>116</span>and comment upon it. Would it not also be discreditable to the philosopher, when listening to
any king, judge, or house-master, about professional affairs, not to be able to understand and comment? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; Assuredly it would be most discreditable upon matters of such grave
moment. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Shall we say then, that upon these matters also, as well as all others, the philosopher ought to be a Pentathlus or second-rate performer, useless so long as the special
craftsman is at hand? or shall we not rather affirm, that he must not confide his own house to any one else, nor be the second-best within it, but must himself judge and punish rightly, if his house
is to be well administered? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; That too I admit.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_20" href="#Footnotev2_16_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Farther, if his friends
shall entrust to him the arbitration of their disputes, &mdash; if the city shall command him to act as Dikast or to settle any difficulty, &mdash; in those cases also it will be disgraceful for him
to stand second or third, and not to be first-rate? <i>Erast.</i> &mdash; I think it will be. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You see then, my friend, philosophy is something very different from much learning
and acquaintance with multifarious arts or sciences.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_21" href="#Footnotev2_16_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a></p>

<p>Upon my saying this (so Sokrates concludes his recital of the conversation) the literary one of the two rivals was ashamed and held his peace; while the gymnastic rival declared that I was in the
right, and the other hearers also commended what I had said.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_16_12" id="Sidenotev2_16_12"></a> Remarks &mdash; animated manner of the dialogue.</span></p>

<p>The antithesis between the philo-gymnast, hater of philosophy, &mdash; and the enthusiastic admirer of philosophy, who nevertheless cannot explain what it is &mdash; gives much point and vivacity
to this short dialogue. This last person is exhibited as somewhat presumptuous and confident; thus affording a sort of excuse for the humiliating <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page117" id=
"v2page117"></a>117</span>cross-examination put upon him by Sokrates to the satisfaction of his stupid rival. Moreover, the dramatic introduction is full of animation, like that of the
Charmid&ecirc;s and Lysis.</p>

<p>Besides the animated style of the dialogue, the points raised for discussion in it are of much interest. The word philosophy has at all times been vague and ambiguous. Certainly no one before
Sokrates &mdash; probably no one before Plato &mdash; ever sought a definition of it. In no other Platonic dialogue than this, is the definition of it made a special topic of research.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_16_13" id="Sidenotev2_16_13"></a> Definition of philosophy &mdash; here sought for the first time &mdash; Platonic conception of measure &mdash; referee
not discovered.</span></p>

<p>It is here handled in Plato&rsquo;s negative, elenchtic, tentative, manner. By some of his contemporaries, philosophy was really considered as equivalent to polymathy, or to much and varied
knowledge: so at least Plato represents it as being considered by Hippias the Sophist, contrary to the opinion of Protagoras.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_22" href="#Footnotev2_16_22"><span class=
"sp">22</span></a> The exception taken by Sokrates to a definition founded on simple quantity, without any standard point of sufficiency by which much or little is to be measured, introduces that
governing idea of &tau;&#8056; &mu;&#941;&tau;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu; (the moderate, that which conforms to a standard measure) upon which Plato insists so much in other more elaborate dialogues.
The conception of a measure, of a standard of measurement &mdash; and of conformity thereunto, as the main constituent of what is good and desirable &mdash; stands prominent in his mind,<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_16_23" href="#Footnotev2_16_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> though it is not always handled in the same way. We have seen it, in the Second Alkibiad&ecirc;s, indicated under another
name as knowledge of Good or of the Best: without which, knowledge on special matters was declared to be hurtful rather than useful.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_24" href="#Footnotev2_16_24"><span class=
"sp">24</span></a> Plato considers that this Measure is neither discernible nor applicable except by a specially trained intelligence. In the Erast&aelig; as elsewhere, such an intelligence is called
for in general terms: but when it is asked, Where is the person possessing such intelligence, available in the case of mental training &mdash; neither Sokrates nor any one else can point him out. To
suggest a question, and direct <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page118" id="v2page118"></a>118</span>attention to it, yet still to leave it unanswered &mdash; is a practice familiar with Plato. In
this respect the Erast&aelig; is like other dialogues. The answer, if any, intended to be understood or divined, is, that such an intelligence is the philosopher himself.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_16_14" id="Sidenotev2_16_14"></a> View taken of the second-best critical talking man, as compared with the special proficient and
practitioner.</span></p>

<p>The second explanation of philosophy here given &mdash; that the philosopher is one who is second-best in many departments, and a good talker upon all, but inferior to the special master in each
&mdash; was supposed by Thrasyllus in ancient times to be pointed at Demokritus. By many Platonic critics, it is referred to those persons whom they single out to be called Sophists. I conceive it to
be applicable (whether intended or not) to the literary men generally of that age, the persons called Sophists included. That which Perikles expressed by the word, when he claimed the love of wisdom
and the love of beauty as characteristic features of the Athenian citizen &mdash; referred chiefly to the free and abundant discussion, the necessity felt by every one for talking over every thing
before it was done, yet accompanied with full energy in action as soon as the resolution was taken to act.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_25" href="#Footnotev2_16_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> Speech,
ready and pertinent, free conflict of opinion on many different topics &mdash; was the manifestation and the measure of knowledge acquired. Sokrates passed his life in talking, with every one
indiscriminately, and upon each man&rsquo;s particular subject; often perplexing the artist himself. Xenophon recounts conversations with various professional men &mdash; a painter, a sculptor, an
armourer &mdash; and informs us that it was instructive to all of them, though Sokrates was no practitioner in any craft.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_26" href="#Footnotev2_16_26"><span class=
"sp">26</span></a> It was not merely Demokritus, but Plato and Aristotle also, who talked or wrote upon almost every subject included in contemporary observation. The voluminous works of Aristotle,
&mdash; the Tim&aelig;us, Republic, and Leges, of Plato, &mdash; embrace a large variety of subjects, on each of which, severally taken, these two great men were second-best or inferior to some
special proficient. Yet both of them had judgments to give, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page119" id="v2page119"></a>119</span>which it was important to hear, upon all subjects:<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_16_27" href="#Footnotev2_16_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> and both of them could probably talk better upon each than the special proficient himself. Aristotle, for example, would
write better upon rhetoric than Demosthenes &mdash; upon tragedy, than Sophokles. Undoubtedly, if an oration or a tragedy were to be composed &mdash; if resolution or action were required on any real
state of particular circumstances &mdash; the special proficient would be called upon to act: but it would be a mistake to infer from hence, as the Platonic Sokrates intimates in the Erast&aelig;,
that the second-best, or theorizing reasoner, was a useless man. The theoretical and critical point of view, with the command of language apt for explaining and defending it, has a value of its own;
distinct from, yet ultimately modifying and improving, the practical. And such comprehensive survey and comparison of numerous objects, without having the attention exclusively fastened or enslaved
to any one of them, deserves to rank high as a variety of intelligence whether it be adopted as the definition of a philosopher, or not.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_16_15" id="Sidenotev2_16_15"></a> Plato&rsquo;s view &mdash; that the philosopher has a province special to himself, distinct from other specialties
&mdash; dimly indicated &mdash; regal or political art.</span></p>

<p>Plato undoubtedly did not conceive the definition of the philosopher in the same way as Sokrates. The close of the Erast&aelig; is employed in opening a distant and dim view of the Platonic
conception. We are given to understand, that the philosopher has a province of his own, wherein he is not second-best, but a first-rate actor and adviser. To indicate, in many different ways, that
there is or must be such a peculiar, appertaining to philosophy &mdash; distinct from, though analogous to, the peculiar of each several art &mdash; is one leading purpose in many Platonic dialogues.
But what is the peculiar of the philosopher? Here, as elsewhere, it is marked out in a sort of misty outline, not as by one who already knows and is familiar with it, but as one who is trying to find
it without being sure that he has succeeded. Here, we have it described as the art of discriminating good from evil, governing, and applying penal sanctions rightly. This is the supreme art or <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page120" id="v2page120"></a>120</span>science, of which the philosopher is the professor; and in which, far from requiring advice from others, he is the only person
competent both to advise and to act: the art which exercises control over all other special arts, directing how far, and on what occasions, each of them comes into appliance. It is philosophy, looked
at in one of its two aspects: not as a body of speculative truth, to be debated, proved, and discriminated from what cannot be proved or can be disproved &mdash; but as a critical judgment bearing on
actual life, prescribing rules or giving directions in particular cases, with a view to the attainment of foreknown ends, recognised as <i>expetenda</i>.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_28" href=
"#Footnotev2_16_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> This is what Plato understands by the measuring or calculating art, the regal or political art, according as we use the language of the Protagoras,
Politikus, Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Republic. Both justice and sobriety are branches of this art; and the distinction between the two loses its importance when the art is considered as a whole &mdash; as we
find both in the Erast&aelig; and in the Republic.<a name="FnAnchorv2_16_29" href="#Footnotev2_16_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a></p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p>This is one of the dialogues declared to be spurious by Schleiermacher, Ast, Socher, and Stallbaum, all of them critics of the present century. In my judgment, their grounds for such declaration
are altogether inconclusive. They think the dialogue an inferior composition, unworthy of Plato; and they accordingly find reasons, more or less ingenious, for relieving Plato from the discredit of
it. I do not think so meanly of the dialogue as they do; but even if I did, I should not pronounce it to be spurious, without some evidence bearing upon that special question. No such evidence, of
any value, is produced.</p>

<p>It is indeed contended, on the authority of a passage in Diogenes (ix. 37), that Thrasyllus himself doubted of the authenticity of the Erast&aelig;. The passage is as follows, in his life of
Demokritus &mdash; &epsilon;&#7988;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; &omicron;&#7985; &#7944;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&#8054; &Pi;&lambda;&#940;&tau;&omega;&nu;&#972;&sigmaf;

&delta;&iota;&alpha;&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;&middot; &#8103;,
&phi;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&nu;, &#8033;&sigmaf; &pi;&epsilon;&nu;&tau;&#940;&theta;&lambda;&#8179; &#7956;&omicron;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&nu; &#8001;
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&#972;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;&middot; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7974;&nu; &#8033;&sigmaf; &#7936;&lambda;&eta;&theta;&#8182;&sigmaf; &#7952;&nu;
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&#8115; &pi;&#941;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&theta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; (Demokritus).</p>

<p>Now in the first place, Schleiermacher and Stallbaum both declare that Thrasyllus can never have said that which Diogenes here makes him say (Schleierm. p. 510; Stallbaum, Prolegg. ad. Erast. p.
266, and not. p. 273).</p>

<p>Next, it is certain that Thrasyllus did consider it the undoubted work of Plato, for he enrolled it in his classification, as the third dialogue in the fourth tetralogy (Diog. L. iii. 59).</p>

<p>Yxem, who defends the genuineness of the Erast&aelig; (Ueber Platon&rsquo;s Kleitophon, pp. 6-7, Berlin, 1846), insists very properly on this point; not merely as an important fact in itself, but
as determining the sense of the words &epsilon;&#7988;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; &omicron;&#7985; &#7944;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&#8054;
&Pi;&lambda;&#940;&tau;&omega;&nu;&#972;&sigmaf; &epsilon;&#7984;&sigma;&iota;, and as showing that the words rather affirm, than deny, the authenticity of the dialogue. &ldquo;If the Anterast&aelig;
are the work of Plato, <i>as they are universally admitted to be</i>.&rdquo; You must supply the parenthesis in this way, in order to make Thrasyllus consistent with himself. Yxem cites a passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page122" id="v2page122"></a>122</span>from Galen, in which &epsilon;&#7988;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; is used, and in which the parenthesis must be supplied in the way
indicated: no doubt at all being meant to be hinted. And I will produce another passage out of Diogenes himself, where &epsilon;&#7988;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; is used in the same way; not as intended to
convey the smallest doubt, but merely introducing the premiss for a conclusion immediately following. Diogenes says, respecting the Platonic Ideas, &epsilon;&#7988;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;
&#7952;&sigma;&tau;&#8054; &mu;&nu;&#942;&mu;&eta;, &tau;&#8048;&sigmaf; &#7984;&delta;&#941;&alpha;&sigmaf; &#7952;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf; &omicron;&#8022;&sigma;&iota;&nu;
&#8017;&pi;&#940;&rho;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; (iii. 15). He does not intend to suggest any doubt whether there be such a fact as memory. &Epsilon;&#7988;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; is sometimes the
equivalent of &#7952;&pi;&epsilon;&iota;&delta;&#942;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;: as we learn from Hermann ad Viger. VIII. 6, p. 512.</p>

<p>There is therefore no fair ground for supposing that Thrasyllus doubted the genuineness of the Erast&aelig;. And when I read what modern critics say in support of their verdict of condemnation, I
feel the more authorised in dissenting from it. I will cite a passage or two from Stallbaum.</p>

<p>Stallbaum begins his Prolegomena as follows, pp. 205-206: &ldquo;Quanquam hic libellus genus dicendi habet purum, castum, elegans, nihil ut inveniri queat quod &agrave; Platonis aut Xenophontis
eleganti&acirc;, abhorreat &mdash; tamen quin &agrave; Boeckhio, Schleiermachero, Astio, Sochero, Knebelio, aliis jure meritoque pro suppositicio habitus sit, haudquaquam dubitamus. Est enim materia
operis adeo non ad Platonis mentem rationemque elaborata, ut potius cuivis alii Socraticorum quam huic rect&egrave; adscribi posse videatur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After stating that the Erast&aelig; may be divided into two principal sections, Stallbaum proceeds:&mdash; &ldquo;Neutra harum partium ita tractata est, ut nihil desideretur, quod ad justam
argumenti explicationem merito requiras &mdash; nihil inculcatum reperiatur, quod vel alio modo illustratum vel omnino omissum esse cupias&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I call attention to this sentence as a fair specimen of the grounds upon which the Platonic critics proceed when they strike dialogues out of the Platonic Canon. If there be anything wanting in it
which is required for what they consider a proper setting forth of the argument &mdash; if there be anything which they would desire to see omitted or otherwise illustrated &mdash; this is with them
a reason for deciding that it is not Plato&rsquo;s work. That is, if there be any defects in it of any kind, it cannot be admitted as Plato&rsquo;s work; &mdash; <i>his genuine works have no
defects</i>. I protest altogether against this <i>ratio decidendi</i>. If I acknowledged it and applied it consistently I should strike out every dialogue in the Canon. Certainly, the presumption in
favour of the Catalogue of Thrasyllus must be counted as <i>nil</i>, if it will not outweigh such feeble counter-arguments as these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page123" id="v2page123"></a>123</span>One reason given by Stallbaum for considering the Erast&aelig; as spurious is, that the Sophists are not derided in it.
&ldquo;Quis est igitur, qui Platonem sibi persuadeat illos non fuisse castigaturum, et omnino non significaturum, quinam illi essent, adversus quos hanc disputationem instituisset?&rdquo; It is
strange to be called on by learned men to strike out all dialogues from the Canon in which there is no derision of the Sophists. Such derision exists already in excess: we hear until we are tired how
mean it is to receive money for lecturing. Again, Stallbaum says that the persons whose opinions are here attacked are not specified by name. But who are the &epsilon;&#7984;&delta;&#8182;&nu;
&phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;, attacked in the Sophist&ecirc;s? They are not specified by name, and critics differ as to the persons intended.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_17_2" id="Sidenotev2_17_2"></a> Rhapsodes as a class in Greece. They competed for prizes at the festivals. Ion has been triumphant.</span></p>

<p>I hold it to be genuine, and it may be comparatively early; but I see no ground for the disparaging criticism which has often been applied to it. The personage whom it introduces to us as
subjected to the cross-examination of Sokrates is a rhapsode of celebrity; one among a class of artists at that time both useful and esteemed. They recited or sang,<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_3" href=
"#Footnotev2_17_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> with appropriate accent and gesture, the compositions of Homer and of other epic poets: thus serving to the Grecian epic, the same purpose as the
actors served to the dramatic, and the harp-singers (&kappa;&iota;&theta;&alpha;&rho;&#8179;&delta;&omicron;&#8054;) to the lyric. There were various solemn festivals such as that of &AElig;sculapius
at Epidaurus, and (most especially) the Panathen&aelig;a at Athens, where prizes were awarded for the competition of the rhapsodes. Ion is described as having competed triumphantly in the festival at
Epidaurus, and carried off the first prize. He appeared there in a splendid costume, crowned <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page125" id="v2page125"></a>125</span>with a golden wreath, amidst a
crowd which is described as containing more than 20,000 persons.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_4" href="#Footnotev2_17_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_17_3" id="Sidenotev2_17_3"></a> Functions of the Rhapsodes. Recitation &mdash; Exposition of the poets. Arbitrary exposition of the poets was then
frequent.</span></p>

<p>Much of the acquaintance of cultivated Greeks with Homer and the other epic poets was both acquired and maintained through such rhapsodes; the best of whom contended at the festivals, while
others, less highly gifted as to vocal power and gesticulation, gave separate declamations and lectures of their own, and even private lessons to individuals.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_5" href=
"#Footnotev2_17_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Euthyd&ecirc;mus, in one of the Xenophontic conversations with Sokrates, and Antisthenes in the Xenophontic Symposion, are made to declare that the
rhapsodes as a class were extremely silly. This, if true at all, can apply only to the expositions and comments with which they accompanied their recital of Homer and other poets. Moreover we cannot
reasonably set it down (though some modern critics do so) as so much incontestable truth: we must consider it as an opinion delivered by one of the speakers in the conversation, but not necessarily
well founded.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_6" href="#Footnotev2_17_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Unquestionably, the comments made upon Homer (both in that age and afterwards) were often fanciful and
misleading. Metrodorus, Anaxagoras, and others, resolved the Homeric narrative into various allegories, physical, ethical, and theological: and most men who had an opinion to defend, rejoiced to be
able to support or enforce it by some passages of Homer, well or ill-explained &mdash; just as texts of the Bible are quoted in modern times. In this manner, Homer was pressed into the service of
every disputant; and the Homeric poems were presented as containing, or at least as implying, doctrines quite foreign to the age in which they were composed.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_7" href=

<p>Seneca, Epistol. 88: &ldquo;modo Stoicum Homerum faciunt &mdash; modo Epicureum &hellip; modo Peripateticum, tria genera bonorum inducentem: modo Academicum, incerta omnia dicentem. Apparet nihil
horum esse in illo, cui omnia insunt: ista enim inter se dissident.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_17_4" id="Sidenotev2_17_4"></a> The popularity of the Rhapsodes was chiefly derived from their recitation. Powerful effect which they
produced.</span></p>

<p>The Rhapsodes, in so far as they interpreted Homer, were <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page126" id="v2page126"></a>126</span>probably not less disposed than others to discover in him their own
fancies. But the character in which they acquired most popularity, was, not as expositors, but as reciters, of the poems. The powerful emotion which, in the process of reciting, they both felt
themselves and communicated to their auditors, is declared in this dialogue: &ldquo;When that which I recite is pathetic (says Ion), my eyes are filled with tears: when it is awful or terrible, my
hair stands on end, and my heart leaps. Moreover I see the spectators also weeping, sympathising with my emotions, and looking aghast at what they hear.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_8" href=
"#Footnotev2_17_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> This assertion of the vehement emotional effect produced by the words of the poet as declaimed or sung by the rhapsode, deserves all the more credit
&mdash; because Plato himself, far from looking upon it favourably, either derides or disapproves it. Accepting it as a matter of fact, we see that the influence of rhapsodes, among auditors
generally, must have been derived more from their efficacy as actors than from their ability as expositors.</p>

<p>The description here given is the more interesting because it is the only intimation remaining of the strong effect produced by these rhapsodic representations.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_17_5" id="Sidenotev2_17_5"></a> Ion both reciter and expositor &mdash; Homer was considered more as an instructor than as a poet.</span></p>

<p>Ion however is described in this dialogue as combining the two functions of reciter and expositor: a partnership like that of Garrick and Johnson, in regard to Shakspeare. It is in the last of the
two functions, that Sokrates here examines him: considering Homer, not as a poet appealing to the emotions of hearers, but as a teacher administering lessons and imparting instruction. Such was the
view of Homer entertained by a large proportion of the Hellenic world. In that capacity, his poems served as a theme for rhapsodes, as well as for various philosophers and Sophists who were not
rhapsodes, nor accomplished reciters.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_17_6" id="Sidenotev2_17_6"></a> Plato disregards and disapproves the poetic or emotional working.</span></p>

<p>The reader must keep in mind, in following the questions put by Sokrates, that this p&aelig;dagogic and edifying view of Homer is the only one present to the men of the Sokratic school &mdash; and
especially to Plato. Of the genuine functions of the gifted poet, who touches the chords of strong and diversified emotion &mdash; &ldquo;qui <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page127" id="v2page127">
</a>127</span>pectus inaniter angit, Irritat, mulcet, falsis terroribus implet&rdquo; (Horat. Epist. II. 1, 212) &mdash; Plato takes no account: or rather, he declares open war against them, either
as childish delusions<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_9" href="#Footnotev2_17_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a>, or as mischievous stimulants, tending to exalt the unruly elements of the mind, and to overthrow
the sovereign authority of reason. We shall find farther manifestations on this point in the Republic and Leges.</p>

<p>Ion professes to have devoted himself to the study of Homer exclusively, neglecting other poets: so that he can interpret the thoughts, and furnish reflections upon them, better than any other
expositor.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_10" href="#Footnotev2_17_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> How does it happen (asked Sokrates) that you have so much to say about Homer, and nothing at all about
other poets? Homer may be the best of all poets: but he is still only one of those who exercise the poetic art, and he must necessarily talk about the same subjects as other poets. Now the art of
poetry is <i>One</i> altogether &mdash; like that of painting, sculpture, playing on the flute, playing on the harp, rhapsodizing, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_11" href="#Footnotev2_17_11"><span

<p>I cannot explain to you how it happens (replies Ion): I only know the fact incontestably &mdash; that when I talk about Homer, my thoughts flow abundantly, and every one tells me that my discourse

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_17_8" id="Sidenotev2_17_8"></a> Explanation given by Sokrates. Both the Rhapsode and the Poet work, not by art and system, but by divine inspiration.
Fine poets are bereft of their reason, and possessed by inspiration from some God.</span></p>

<p><i>I</i> can explain it (says Sokrates). Your talent in expounding Homer is not an art, acquired by system and method &mdash; otherwise it would have been applicable to other poets besides. It is
a special gift, imparted to you by divine power and inspiration. The like is true of the poet whom you expound. His genius does not spring from art, system, or method: it is a special gift
emanating<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page128" id="v2page128"></a>128</span> from the inspiration of the Muses.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_13" href="#Footnotev2_17_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> A
poet is a light, airy, holy, person, who cannot compose verses at all so long as his reason remains within him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_14" href="#Footnotev2_17_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> The
Muses take away his reason, substituting in place of it their own divine inspiration and special impulse, either towards epic, dithyramb, encomiastic hymns, hyporchemata, &amp;c., one or other of
these. Each poet receives one of these special gifts, but is incompetent for any of the others: whereas, if their ability had been methodical or artistic, it would have displayed itself in all of
them alike. Like prophets, and deliverers of oracles, these poets have their reason taken away, and become servants of the Gods.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_15" href="#Footnotev2_17_15"><span class=
"sp">15</span></a> It is not <i>they</i> who, bereft of their reason, speak in such sublime strains: it is the God who speaks to us, and speaks through them. You may see this by Tynnichus of Chalkis;
who composed his P&aelig;an, the finest of all P&aelig;ans, which is in every one&rsquo;s mouth, telling us himself, that it was the invention of the Muses &mdash; but who never composed anything
else worth hearing. It is through this worthless poet that the God has sung the most sublime hymn:<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_16" href="#Footnotev2_17_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> for the express
purpose of showing us that these fine compositions are not human performances at all, but divine: and that the poet is only an interpreter of the Gods, possessed by one or other of them, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>Homer is thus (continues Sokrates) not a man of art or reason, but the interpreter of the Gods; deprived of his reason, but possessed, inspired, by them. You, Ion, are the interpreter of Homer:

contact with the Magnet itself: the second is suspended to the first, the third to the second, and so on. The attractive influence of the Magnet is thus transmitted through a succession of different
rings, so as to keep suspended several which are a good way removed from itself. So the influence of the Gods is exerted directly and immediately upon Homer: through him, it passes by a second stage
to you: through him and you, it passes by a third stage to those auditors whom you so powerfully affect and delight, becoming however comparatively enfeebled at each stage of transition.</p>

their own compositions, he concluded that they composed without any wisdom of their own, under the same inspiration as prophets and declarers of oracles. In the dialogue before us, this thought is
strikingly illustrated and amplified.</p>

madness inspired by the Gods. Varieties of madness, good and bad.</span></p>

<p>The contrast between systematic, professional, procedure, deliberately taught and consciously acquired, capable of being defended at every step by appeal to intelligible rules founded upon
scientific theory, and enabling the person so qualified to impart his qualification to others &mdash; and a different procedure purely impulsive and unthinking, whereby the agent, having in his mind
a conception of the end aimed at, proceeds from one intermediate step to another, without knowing why he does so or how he has come to do so, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page130" id=
"v2page130"></a>130</span>without being able to explain his practice if questioned or to impart it to others &mdash; this contrast is a favourite one with Plato. The last-mentioned procedure &mdash;
the unphilosophical or irrational &mdash; he conceives under different aspects: sometimes as a blind routine or insensibly acquired habit,<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_19" href="#Footnotev2_17_19"><span
class="sp">19</span></a> sometimes as a stimulus applied from without by some God, superseding the reason of the individual. Such a condition Plato calls <i>madness</i>, and he considers those under
it as persons out of their senses. But he recognises different varieties of madness, according to the God from whom it came: the bad madness was a disastrous visitation and distemper &mdash; the good
madness was a privilege and blessing, an inspiration superior to human reason. Among these privileged madmen he reckoned prophets and poets; another variety under the same genus, is, that mental
love, between a well-trained adult, and a beautiful, intelligent, youth, which he regards as the most exalted of all human emotions.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_20" href="#Footnotev2_17_20"><span class=
"sp">20</span></a> In the Ion, this idea of a privileged madness &mdash; inspiration from the Gods superseding reason &mdash; is applied not only to the poet, but also to the rhapsode who recites the
poem, and even to the auditors whom he addresses. The poet receives the inspiration directly from the Gods: he inoculates the rhapsode with it, who again inoculates the auditors &mdash; the fervour
is, at each successive communication, diminished. The auditor represents the last of the rings; held in suspension, through the intermediate agency of other rings, by the inherent force of the
magnet.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_21" href="#Footnotev2_17_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a></p>

Sokrates &mdash; his firm belief in them.</span></p>

<p>We must remember, that privileged communications from the Gods to men, and special persons recipient thereof, were acknowledged and witnessed everywhere as a constant phenomenon of Grecian life.
There were not only numerous oracular temples, which every one could visit to ask questions in matters of doubt &mdash; but also favoured persons who had received from the Gods the gift of predicting
the future, of interpreting omens, of determining the good or bad indications <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page131" id="v2page131"></a>131</span>furnished by animals sacrificed.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_17_22" href="#Footnotev2_17_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> In every town or village &mdash; or wherever any body of men were assembled &mdash; there were always persons who prophesied
or delivered oracles, and to whom special revelations were believed to be vouchsafed, during periods of anxiety. No one was more familiar with this fact than the Sokratic disciples: for Sokrates
himself had perhaps a greater number of special communications from the Gods than any man of his age: his divine sign having begun when he was a child, and continuing to move him frequently, even
upon small matters, until his death: though the revelations were for the most part negative, not affirmative &mdash; telling him often what was not to be done &mdash; seldom what was to be done
&mdash; resembling in this respect his own dialogues with other persons. Moreover Sokrates inculcated upon his friends emphatically, that they ought to have constant recourse to prophecy: that none
but impious men neglected to do so: that the benevolence of the Gods was nowhere more conspicuous than in their furnishing such special revelations and warnings, to persons whom they favoured: that
the Gods administered the affairs of the world partly upon principles of regular sequence, so that men by diligent study might learn what they were to expect, &mdash; but partly also, and by design,
in a manner irregular and undecypherable, such that it could not be fathomed by any human study, and could not be understood except through direct and special revelation from themselves.<a name=

<p>It is plain from Xenophon (Mem. i. 1, 3) that many persons were offended with Sokrates because they believed, &mdash; or at least because he affirmed &mdash; that he received more numerous and

<p>Here, as well as elsewhere, Plato places inspiration, both of the prophet and the poet, in marked contrast with reason and intelligence. Reason is supposed to be for the time withdrawn or
abolished, and inspiration is introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page132" id="v2page132"></a>132</span> by the Gods into its place. &ldquo;When Monarch Reason sleeps, this mimic wakes.&rdquo;
The person inspired (prophet or poet) becomes for the time the organ of an extraneous agency, speaking what he neither originates nor understands. The genuine gift of prophecy<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_17_24" href="#Footnotev2_17_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> (Plato says) attaches only to a disabled, enfeebled, distempered, condition of the intelligence; the gift of poetry is
conferred by the Gods upon the most inferior men, as we see by the case of Tynnichus &mdash; whose sublime p&aelig;an shows us, that it is the Gods alone who utter fine poetry through the organs of a
person himself thoroughly incompetent.</p>

<p>It is thus that Plato, setting before himself a process of systematised reason, &mdash; originating in a superior intellect, laying down universal principles and deducing consequences from them
&mdash; capable of being consistently applied, designedly taught, and defended against objections &mdash; enumerates the various mental conditions opposed to it, and ranks inspiration as one of them.
In this dialogue, Sokrates seeks to prove that the success of Ion as a rhapsode depends upon his being out of his mind or inspired. But Ion does not accept the compliment: <i>Ion.</i> &mdash; You
speak well, Sokrates; but I should be surprised if you spoke well enough to create in me the new conviction, that I am possessed and mad when I eulogize Homer. I do not think that you would even

fine discourse about Homer, you will not even comply with my preliminary entreaty &mdash; that you will first tell me what those matters are, on which your superiority bears. You twist every way like

<p>It seems strange to read such language put into Ion&rsquo;s mouth (we are not warranted in regarding it as what any rhapsode ever did say), as the affirmation &mdash; that every good rhapsode was
also a good general, and that he <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page135" id="v2page135"></a>135</span>had become the best of generals simply through complete acquaintance with Homer. But this is
only a caricature of a sentiment largely prevalent at Athens, according to which the works of the poets, especially the Homeric poems, were supposed to be a mine of varied instruction, and were
taught as such to youth.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_31" href="#Footnotev2_17_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> In Greece, the general was not often required (except at Sparta, and not always even there)
to possess professional experience.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_32" href="#Footnotev2_17_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> Sokrates, in one of the Xenophontic conversations, tries to persuade
Nikomachides, a practised soldier (who had failed in getting himself elected general, because a successful Chor&ecirc;gus had been preferred to him), how much the qualities of an effective
Chor&ecirc;gus coincided with those of an effective general.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_33" href="#Footnotev2_17_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> The poet Sophokles was named by the Athenians one of the
generals of the very important armament for reconquering Samos: though Perikles, one of his colleagues, as well as his contemporary declared that he was an excellent poet, but knew nothing of
generalship.<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_34" href="#Footnotev2_17_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> Plato frequently seeks to make it evident how little the qualities required for governing numbers,
either civil or military, were made matter of professional study or special teaching. The picture of Homer conveyed in the tenth book of the Platonic Republic is, that of a man who pretends to know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page136" id="v2page136"></a>136</span>everything, but really knows nothing: an imitative artist, removed by two stages from truth and reality, &mdash; who gives the
shadows of shadows, resembling only enough to satisfy an ignorant crowd. This is the picture there presented of poets generally, and of Homer as the best among them. The rhapsode Ion is here brought
under the same category as the poet Homer, whom he has by heart and recites. The whole field of knowledge is assumed to be distributed among various specialties, not one of which either of the two
can claim. Accordingly, both of them under the mask of universal knowledge, conceal the reality of universal ignorance.</p>

<p>Ion is willing enough (as he promises) to exhibit before Sokrates one of his eloquent discourses upon Homer. But Sokrates never permits him to arrive at it: arresting him always by preliminary
questions, and requiring him to furnish an intelligible description of the matter which his discourse is intended to embrace, and thus to distinguish it from other matters left untouched. A man who
cannot comply with this requisition, &mdash; who cannot (to repeat what I said in a previous chapter) stand a Sokratic cross-examination on the subject &mdash; possesses no rational intelligence of
his own proceedings: no art, science, knowledge, system, or method. If as a practitioner he executes well what he promises (which is often the case), and attains success &mdash; he does so either by
blind imitation of some master, or else under the stimulus and guidance of some agency foreign to himself &mdash; of the Gods or Fortune.</p>

<p>This is the Platonic point of view; developed in several different ways and different dialogues, but hardly anywhere more conspicuously than in the Ion.</p>

<p>I have observed that in this dialogue, Ion is anxious to embark on his eloquent expository discourse, but Sokrates will not allow him to begin: requiring as a preliminary stage that certain
preliminary difficulties shall first be cleared up. Here we have an illustration of Plato&rsquo;s doctrine, to which I adverted in a former chapter,<a name="FnAnchorv2_17_35" href=

geometry to one ignorant thereof. The geometrical writer begins by laying down a string of definitions and axioms; and then strikes out boldly in demonstrating his theorems. But Plato would refuse
him the liberty of striking out, until he should have cleared up the preliminary difficulties about the definitions and axioms themselves. This the geometrical treatise does not even attempt.<a name=

<h2><a name="Platovol2ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h2>LACHES.</h2>

<p>The main substance of this dialogue consists of a discussion, carried on by Sokrates with Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s, respecting Courage. Each of the two latter proposes an explanation of Courage:
Sokrat&ecirc;s criticises both of them, and reduces each to a confessed contradiction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_1" id="Sidenotev2_18_1"></a> Lach&ecirc;s. Subject and persons of the dialogue, Whether it is useful that two young men should receive lessons from a
master of arms. Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s differ in opinion.</span></p>

<p>The discussion is invited, or at least dramatically introduced, by two elderly men &mdash; Lysimachus, son of Aristeides the Just, &mdash; and Mel&ecirc;sias, son of Thucydides the rival of
Perikles. Lysimachus and Mel&ecirc;sias, confessing with shame that they are inferior to their fathers, because their education has been neglected, wish to guard against the same misfortune in the
case of their own sons: respecting the education of whom, they ask the advice of Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s. The question turns especially upon the propriety of causing their sons to receive lessons
from a master of arms just then in vogue. Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s, both of them not merely distinguished citizens but also commanders of Athenian armies, are assumed to be well qualified to give
advice. Accordingly they deliver their opinions: Nikias approving such lessons as beneficial, in exalting the courage of a young man, and rendering him effective on the field of battle: while
Lach&ecirc;s takes an opposite view, disparages the masters of arms as being no soldiers, and adds that they are despised by the Laced&aelig;monians, to whose authority on military matters general
deference was paid in Greece.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_1" href="#Footnotev2_18_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Sokrat&ecirc;s, &mdash; commended greatly by <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page139" id=
"v2page139"></a>139</span>Nikias for his acuteness and sagacity, by Lach&ecirc;s for his courage in the battle of Delium, &mdash; is invited to take part in the consultation. Being younger than both,
he waits till they have delivered their opinions, and is then called upon to declare with which of the two his own judgment will concur.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_2" href="#Footnotev2_18_2"><span class=

<p>Nikias is made to say that Sokrates has recently recommended to him Damon, as a teacher of &mu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#8052; to his sons, and that Damon had proved an admirable
teacher as well as companion (180 D). Damon is mentioned by Plato generally with much eulogy.</p>

judge.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The question must not be determined by a plurality of votes, but by superiority of knowledge.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_3" href="#Footnotev2_18_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> If
we were debating about the proper gymnastic discipline for these young men, we should consult a known artist or professional trainer, or at least some one who had gone through a course of teaching
and practice under the trainer. The first thing to be enquired therefore is, whether, in reference to the point now under discussion, there be any one of us professionally or technically competent,
who has studied under good masters, and has proved his own competence as a master by producing well-trained pupils. The next thing is, to understand clearly what it is, with reference to which such
competence is required.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_4" href="#Footnotev2_18_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> <i>Nikias.</i> &mdash; Surely the point before us is, whether it be wise to put these young men
under the lessons of the master of arms? That is what we want to know. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Doubtless it is: but that is only one particular branch of a wider and more comprehensive enquiry. When you
are considering whether a particular ointment is good for your eyes, it is your eyes, and their general benefit, which form the subject of investigation &mdash; not the ointment simply. The person to
assist you will be, he who understands professionally the general treatment of the eyes. So in this case, you are enquiring whether lessons in arms will be improving for the minds and character of
your sons. Look out therefore for some one who is professionally competent, from having studied under good masters, in regard to the general treatment of the mind.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_5" href=
"#Footnotev2_18_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Lach&ecirc;s.</i> &mdash; But there are various persons who, without ever having studied under masters, possess greater technical competence<span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page140" id="v2page140"></a>140</span> than others who have so studied. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; There are such persons: but you will never believe it upon their own assurance,
unless they can show you some good special work actually performed by themselves.</p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now then, Lysimachus, since you have invited Lach&ecirc;s and Nikias, as well as me, to advise you on the means of most effectively improving the mind of your son, it is for
us to show you that we possess competent professional skill respecting the treatment of the youthful mind. We must declare to you who are the masters from whom we have learnt, and we must prove their
qualifications. Or if we have had no masters, we must demonstrate to you our own competence by citing cases of individuals, whom we have successfully trained, and who have become incontestably good
under our care. If we can fulfil neither of these two conditions, we ought to confess our incompetence and decline advising you. We must not begin to try our hands upon so precious a subject as the

<p>As to myself, I frankly confess that I have neither had any master to impart to me such competence, nor have I been able to acquire it by my own efforts. I am not rich enough to pay the Sophists,
who profess to teach it. But as to Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s, they are both older and richer than I am: so that they may well have learnt it from others, or acquired it for themselves. They must be
thoroughly satisfied of their own knowledge on the work of education; otherwise they would hardly have given such confident opinions, pronouncing what pursuits are good or bad for youth. For my part,
I trust them implicitly: the only thing which surprises me, is, that they dissent from each other.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_7" href="#Footnotev2_18_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> It is for you
therefore, Lysimachus, to ask Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s, &mdash; Who have been their masters? Who have been their fellow-pupils? If they have been their own masters, what proof can they produce of

least cite sufficient examples of men whom he has taught well himself. This is the Sokratic comparison, assimilating the general art of living well to the requirements of a special profession, which
a man must learn through express teaching, from a master who has proved his ability, and through conscious application of his own. Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s give their opinions offhand and confidently,
upon the question whether lessons from the master of arms be profitable to youth or not. Plato, on the contrary, speaking through Sokrates, points out that this is only one branch of the more
comprehensive question as to education generally &mdash; &ldquo;What are the qualities and habits proper to be imparted to youth by training? What is the proper treatment of the mind? No one <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page142" id="v2page142"></a>142</span>is competent to decide the special question, except he who has professionally studied the treatment of the mind.&rdquo; To deal with
the special question, without such preliminary general preparation, involves rash and unverified assumptions, which render any opinion so given dangerous to act upon. Such is the judgment of the
Platonic Sokrates, insisting on the necessity of taking up ethical questions in their most comprehensive aspect.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_6" id="Sidenotev2_18_6"></a> Appeal of Sokrates to the judgment of the One Wise Man &mdash; this man is never seen or identified.</span></p>

<p>Consequent upon this preamble, we should expect that Lach&ecirc;s and Nikias would be made to cite the names of those who had been their masters; or to produce some examples of persons effectively
taught by themselves. This would bring us a step nearer to that One Wise Man &mdash; often darkly indicated, but nowhere named or brought into daylight &mdash; from whom alone we can receive a
trustworthy judgment. But here, as in the Kriton and so many other Platonic dialogues, we get only a Pisgah view of our promised adviser &mdash; nothing more. The discussion takes a different
turn.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_8" id="Sidenotev2_18_8"></a> Question &mdash; what is courage? Lach&ecirc;s answers by citing one particularly manifest case of courage. Mistake of
not giving a general explanation.</span></p>

<p>Here is the same error in replying, as was committed by Euthyphron when asked, What is the Holy? and by Hippias, about the Beautiful. One particular case of courageous behaviour, among many, is
indicated, as if it were an explanation of the whole: but the general feature common to all acts of courage is not declared. Sokrates points out that men are courageous, not merely among hoplites who
keep their rank and fight, but also among the Scythian horsemen who fight while running away; others also are courageous against disease, poverty, political adversity, pain and fear of every sort;
others moreover, against desires and pleasures. What is the common attribute which in all these cases constitutes Courage? If you asked me what is <i>quickness</i> &mdash; common to all those cases
when a man runs, speaks, plays, learns, &amp;c., quickly &mdash; I should tell you that it was that which accomplished much in a little time. Tell me in like manner, what is the common fact or
attribute pervading all cases of courage?</p>

<p>Lach&ecirc;s at first does not understand the question:<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_13" href="#Footnotev2_18_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> and Sokrates elucidates it by giving the parallel
explanation of quickness. Here, as elsewhere, Plato takes great pains to impress the conception in its full generality, and he seems to have found difficulty in making others follow him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_9" id="Sidenotev2_18_9"></a> Second answer. Courage is a sort of endurance of the mind. Sokrates points out that the answer is vague and incorrect.
Endurance is not always courage: even intelligent endurance is not always courage.</span></p>

<p>Lach&ecirc;s then gives a general definition of courage. It is a sort of endurance of the mind.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_14" href="#Footnotev2_18_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

<p>Surely not <i>all</i> endurance (rejoins Sokrates)? You admit that courage is a fine and honourable thing. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page144" id="v2page144"></a>144</span>But endurance
without intelligence is hurtful and dishonourable: it cannot therefore be courage. Only intelligent endurance, therefore, can be courage. And then what is meant by <i>intelligent</i>? Intelligent
&mdash; of what &mdash; or to what end? A man, who endures the loss of money, understanding well that he will thereby gain a larger sum, is he courageous? No. He who endures fighting, knowing that he
has superior skill, numbers, and all other advantages on his side, manifests more of intelligent endurance, than his adversary who knows that he has all these advantages against him, yet who
nevertheless endures fighting. Nevertheless this latter is the most courageous of the two.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_15" href="#Footnotev2_18_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Unintelligent endurance is
in this case courage: but unintelligent endurance was acknowledged to be bad and hurtful, and courage to be a fine thing. We have entangled ourselves in a contradiction. We must at least show our own
courage, by enduring until we can get right. For my part (replies Lach&ecirc;s) I am quite prepared for such endurance. I am piqued and angry that I cannot express what I conceive. I seem to have in
my mind clearly what courage is: but it escapes me somehow or other, when I try to put it in words.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_16" href="#Footnotev2_18_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

defeat, than victory:&mdash; loss of wealth, than gain. None except the person who can discriminate these cases, knows what is really terrible and what is not so. He alone is really courageous.<a

future events cannot be had without intelligence of past or present.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You do not admit, then, Nikias, that lions, tigers, boars, &amp;c., and such animals, are courageous? <i>Nikias.</i> &mdash; No: they are without fear &mdash; simply from not
knowing the danger &mdash; like children: but they are not courageous, though most people call them so. I may call them bold, but I reserve the epithet courageous for the intelligent. <i>
Lach&ecirc;s.</i> &mdash; See how Nikias strips those, whom every one admits to be courageous, of this honourable appellation! <i>Nikias.</i> &mdash; Not altogether, Lach&ecirc;s: I admit you, and
Lamachus, and many other Athenians, to be courageous, and of course therefore intelligent. <i>Lach&ecirc;s.</i> &mdash; I feel the compliment: but such subtle distinctions befit a Sophist rather than
a general in high command.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_20" href="#Footnotev2_18_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The highest measure of intelligence befits one in the highest
command. What you have said, Nikias, deserves careful examination. You remember that in taking up the investigation of courage, we reckoned it only as a portion of virtue: you are aware that there
are other portions of virtue, such as justice, temperance, and the like. Now you define courage to be, intelligence of what is terrible or not terrible: of that which causes <span class="pagenum"><a
name="v2page146" id="v2page146"></a>146</span>fear, or does not cause fear. But nothing causes fear, except future or apprehended evils: present or past evils cause no fear. Hence courage, as you
define it, is intelligence respecting future evils, and future events not evil. But how can there be intelligence respecting the future, except in conjunction with intelligence respecting the present
and the past? In every special department, such as medicine, military proceedings, agriculture, &amp;c., does not the same man, who knows the phenomena of the future, know also the phenomena of
present and past? Are they not all inseparable acquirements of one and the same intelligent mind?<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_21" href="#Footnotev2_18_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a></p>

<p>Assuredly the distinctions which here Plato puts into the mouth of Nikias are nowise more subtle than those which he is perpetually putting into the mouth of Sokrates. He cannot here mean to

of good and evil generally &mdash; it follows that courage is the knowledge of good and evil generally.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_22" href="#Footnotev2_18_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> But a man who
knows thus much, cannot be destitute of any part of virtue. He must possess temperance and justice as well as courage. Courage, therefore, according to your definition, is not only a part of virtue,
it is the whole. Now we began the enquiry by stating that it was only a part of virtue, and that there were other parts of virtue which it did not comprise. It is plain therefore that your definition
of courage is not precise, and cannot be sustained. We have not yet discovered what courage is.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_23" href="#Footnotev2_18_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_13" id="Sidenotev2_18_13"></a> Remarks. Warfare of Sokrates against the false persuasion of knowledge. Brave generals deliver opinions confidently
about courage without knowing what it is.</span></p>

<p>Here ends the dialogue called Lach&ecirc;s, without any positive result. Nothing is proved except the ignorance of two brave and eminent generals respecting the moral attribute known by the name
<i>Courage</i>: which nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page147" id="v2page147"></a>147</span> they are known to possess, and have the full sentiment and persuasion of knowing perfectly;
so that they give confident advice as to the means of imparting it. &ldquo;I am unaccustomed to debates like these&rdquo; (says Lach&ecirc;s): &ldquo;but I am piqued and mortified &mdash; because I
feel that I know well what Courage is, yet somehow or other I cannot state my own thoughts in words.&rdquo; Here is a description<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_24" href="#Footnotev2_18_24"><span class=
"sp">24</span></a> of the intellectual deficiency which Sokrates seeks to render conspicuous to the consciousness, instead of suffering it to remain latent and unknown, as it is in the ordinary mind.
Here, as elsewhere, he impugns the false persuasion of knowledge, and the unconscious presumption of estimable men in delivering opinions upon ethical and social subjects, which have become familiar
and interwoven with deeply rooted associations, but have never been studied under a master, nor carefully analysed and discussed, nor looked at in their full generality. This is a mental defect which
he pronounces to be universal: belonging not less to men of action like Nikias and Lach&ecirc;s, than to Sophists and Rhetors like Protagoras and Gorgias.</p>

<p>Compare the Charmid&ecirc;s p. 159 A, 160 D, where Sokrates professes to tell Charmides, If temperance is really in you, you can of course inform us what it is.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_14" id="Sidenotev2_18_14"></a> No solution given by Plato. Apparent tendency of his mind, in looking for a solution. Intelligence &mdash; cannot be
understood without reference to some object or end.</span></p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, Plato (or the Platonic Sokrates) exposes the faulty solutions of others, but proposes no better solution of his own, and even disclaims all ability to do so. We may
nevertheless trace, in the refutation which he gives of the two unsatisfactory explanations, hints guiding the mind into that direction in which Plato looks to supply the deficiency. Thus when
Lach&ecirc;s, after having given as his first answer (to the question, What is Courage?) a definition not even formally sufficient, is put by Sokrates upon giving his second answer, &mdash; That
Courage is intelligent endurance: Sokrates asks him<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_25" href="#Footnotev2_18_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> &mdash; &ldquo;Yes, <i>intelligent</i>: but intelligent to <span

simply taken, is altogether undefined; that intelligence must relate to <i>something</i> &mdash; and when human conduct is in question, must relate to some end; and that the Something, and the End,
to which it relates, must be set forth, before the proposition can be clearly understood.</p>

intelligence is not possessed by professional artists.</span></p>

<p>Coming to the answer given by Nikias, we perceive that this deficiency is in a certain manner supplied. Courage is said to consist in knowledge: in knowledge of things terrible, and things not
terrible. When Lach&ecirc;s applies his cross-examination to the answer, the manner in which Nikias defends it puts us upon a distinction often brought to view, though not always adhered to, in the
Platonic writings. There can be no doubt that death, distemper, loss of wealth, defeat, &amp;c. are terrible things (<i>i.e.</i> the prospect of them inspires fear) in the estimation of mankind
generally. Correct foresight of such contingencies, and of the antecedents tending to produce or avert them, is possessed by the physician and other professional persons: who would therefore, it
should seem, possess the knowledge of things terrible and not terrible. But Nikias denies this. He does not admit that the contingencies here enumerated are, always or necessarily, proper objects of
fear. In some cases, he contends, they are the least of two evils. Before you can be said to possess the knowledge of things terrible and not terrible, you must be able to take correct measure not
only of the intervening antecedents or means, but also of the end itself as compared with other alternative ends: whether, in each particular case, it be the end most to be feared, or the real evil
under the given circumstances. The professional man can do the former, but he cannot do the latter. He advises as to means, and executes: but he assumes his own one end as an indisputable datum. The
physician seeks to cure his patient, without ever enquiring whether it may not be a less evil for such patient to die than to survive.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_16" id="Sidenotev2_18_16"></a> Postulate of a Science of Ends, or Teleology, dimly indicated by Plato. The Unknown Wise Man &mdash; correlates with
the undiscovered Science of Ends.</span></p>

<p>The ulterior, yet not less important, estimate of the comparative worth of different ends, is reserved for that unknown master whom Nikias himself does not farther <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page149" id="v2page149"></a>149</span>specify, and whom Lach&ecirc;s sets aside as nowhere to be found, under the peculiar phrase of &ldquo;some God&rdquo;. Subjectively considered, this is an
appeal to the judgment of that One Wise Man, often alluded to by Plato as an absent Expert who might be called into court &mdash; yet never to be found at the exact moment, nor produced in visible
presence: Objectively considered, it is a postulate or divination of some yet undiscovered Teleology or Science of Ends: that Science of the Good, which (as we have already noticed in
Alkibiad&ecirc;s II.) Plato pronounces to be the crowning and capital science of all &mdash; and without which he there declared, that knowledge on all other topics was useless and even worse than
useless.<a name="FnAnchorv2_18_26" href="#Footnotev2_18_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> The One Wise Man &mdash; the <i>Science of Good</i> &mdash; are the Subject and Object corresponding to each
other, and postulated by Plato. None but the One Wise Man can measure things terrible and not terrible: none else can estimate the good or evil, or the comparative value of two alternative evils, in
each individual case. The items here directed to be taken into the calculation, correspond with what is laid down by Sokrates in the Protagoras, not with that laid down in the Gorgias: we find here
none of that marked antithesis between pleasure and good &mdash; between pain and evil &mdash; upon which Sokrates expatiates in the Gorgias.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_18_17" id="Sidenotev2_18_17"></a> Perfect condition of the intelligence &mdash; is the one sufficient condition of virtue.</span></p>

<p>This appears still farther when the cross-examination is taken up by Sokrates instead of by Lach&ecirc;s. We are then made to perceive, that the knowledge of things terrible and not terrible is a
part, but an inseparable part, of the knowledge of good and evil generally: the lesser cannot be had without the greater &mdash; and the greater carries with it not merely courage, but all the other
virtues besides. None can know good or evil generally except the perfectly Wise Man. The perfect condition of the Intelligence, is the sole and all-sufficient condition of virtue. None can possess
one mode of virtue separately.</p>

<p>This is the doctrine to which the conclusion of the Lach&ecirc;s points, though the question debated is confessedly left without solution. It is a doctrine which seems to have been really
maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page150" id="v2page150"></a>150</span> by the historical Sokrates, and is often implied in the reasonings of the Platonic Sokrates, but not always nor
consistently.</p>

<p>In reference to this dialogue, the dramatic contrast is very forcible, between the cross-examination carried on by Lach&ecirc;s, and that carried on by Sokrates. The former is pettish and
impatient, bringing out no result, and accusing the respondent of cavil and disingenuousness: the latter takes up the same answer patiently, expands it into the full generality wrapped up in it, and
renders palpable its inconsistency with previous admissions.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<p>Ast is the only critic who declares the Lach&ecirc;s not to be Plato&rsquo;s work (Platon&rsquo;s Leben und Schr. pp. 451-456). He indeed even finds it difficult to imagine how Schleiermacher can
accept it as genuine (p. 454). He justifies this opinion by numerous reasons &mdash; pointing out what he thinks glaring defects, absurdity, and bad taste, both in the ratiocination and in the
dramatic handling, also <i>dicta</i> alleged to be <i>un-Platonic</i>. Compare Schleiermacher&rsquo;s Einleitung zum Lach&ecirc;s, p. 324 seq.</p>

<p>I do not concur with Ast in the estimation of those passages which serve as premisses to his conclusion. But even if I admitted his premisses, I still should not admit his conclusion. I should
conclude that the dialogue was an inferior work of Plato, but I should conclude nothing beyond. Stallbaum (Prolegg. ad Lachet. p. 29-30, 2nd ed.) and Socher discover &ldquo;adolescenti&aelig;
vestigia&rdquo; in it, which are not apparent to me.</p>

<p>Socher, Stallbaum, and K. F. Hermann pass lightly over the objections of Ast; and Steinhart (Einleit. p. 355) declares them to be unworthy of a serious answer. For my part, I draw from these
dissensions among the Platonic critics a conviction of the uncertain evidence upon which all of them proceed. Each has his own belief as to what Plato <i>must</i> say, <i>ought to</i> say, and <i>
could not</i> have said; and each adjudicates thereupon with a degree of confidence which surprises me. The grounds upon which Ast rejects Lach&ecirc;s, Charmid&ecirc;s, and Lysis, though
inconclusive, appear to me not more inconclusive than those on which he and other critics reject the Erast&aelig;, Theag&ecirc;s. Hippias Major, Alkibiad&ecirc;s II., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The dates which Stallbaum, Schleiermacher, Socher, and Steinhart assign to the Lach&ecirc;s (about 406-404 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) are in my judgment erroneous. I have already shown my reasons for believing that not one of the Platonic dialogues was composed until after the death of Sokrates. The hypotheses also of Steinhart (p.
357) as to the special purposes of Plato in composing the dialogue are unsupported by any evidence; <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page152" id="v2page152"></a>152</span>and are all imagined so as
to fit his supposition as to the date. So also Schleiermacher tells us that a portion of the Lach&ecirc;s is intended by Plato as a defence of himself against accusations which had been brought
against him, a young man, for impertinence in having attacked Lysias in the Ph&aelig;drus, and Protagoras in the Protagoras, both of them much older than Plato. But Steinhart justly remarks that this
explanation can only be valid if we admit Schleiermacher&rsquo;s theory that the Ph&aelig;drus and the Protagoras are earlier compositions than the Lach&ecirc;s, which theory Steinhart and most of
the others deny. Steinhart himself adapts his hypotheses to his own idea of the date of the Lach&ecirc;s: and he is open to the same remark as he himself makes upon Schleiermacher.</p>

<h2>CHARMIDES.</h2>

<p>As in Lach&ecirc;s, we have pursued an enquiry into the nature of Courage &mdash; so in Charmid&ecirc;s, we find an examination of Temperance, Sobriety, Moderation.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_1" href=
"#Footnotev2_19_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Both dialogues conclude without providing any tenable explanation. In both there is an abundant introduction &mdash; in Charmid&ecirc;s, there is even
the bustle of a crowded pal&aelig;stra, with much dramatic incident &mdash; preluding to the substantive discussion. I omit the notice of this dramatic incident, though it is highly interesting to

<p>The two persons with whom Sokrates here carries on the discussion, are Charmides and Kritias; both of whom, as historical persons, were active movers in the oligarchical government of the Thirty,
with its numerous enormities. In this dialogue, Charmides appears as a youth just rising into manhood, strikingly beautiful both in face and stature: Kritias his cousin is an accomplished literary
man of mature age. The powerful emotion which Sokrates describes himself as experiencing,<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_2" href="#Footnotev2_19_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> from the sight and close
neighbourhood of the beautiful Charmides, is remarkable, as a manifestation of Hellenic sentiment. The same exaltation of the feelings and imagination, which is now produced only by beautiful women,
was then excited chiefly by fine youths. Charmides is described by Kritias as exhibiting dispositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page154" id="v2page154"></a>154</span> at once philosophical and
poetical:<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_3" href="#Footnotev2_19_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> illustrating the affinity of these two intellectual veins, as Plato conceived them. He is also described as
eminently temperate and modest:<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_4" href="#Footnotev2_19_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> from whence the questions of Sokrates take their departure.</p>

<p>You are said to be temperate, Charmides (says Sokrates). If so, your temperance will surely manifest itself within you in some way, so as to enable you to form and deliver an opinion, What
Temperance is. Tell us in plain language what you conceive it to be. Temperance, replies Charmides (after some hesitation),<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_5" href="#Footnotev2_19_5"><span class=
"sp">5</span></a> consists in doing every thing in an orderly and sedate manner, when we walk in the highway, or talk, or perform other matters in the presence of others. It is, in short, a kind of
sedateness or slowness.</p>

contrary. Temperance cannot be slowness.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates begins his cross-examination upon this answer, in the same manner as he had begun it with Laches in respect to courage. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Is not temperance a fine and honourable thing?
Does it not partake of the essence and come under the definition, of what is fine or and honourable?<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_6" href="#Footnotev2_19_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> <i>Char.</i>

jumping, learning, teaching, recollecting, comprehending, deliberating, determining, &amp;c. &mdash; we shall find that to do them quickly is more fine and honourable than to do them slowly. Slowness

<p>Charmides next declares Temperance to be a variety of the feeling of shame or modesty. But this (observes Sokrates) will not hold more than the former explanation: since Homer has pronounced shame
not to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page155" id="v2page155"></a>155</span>good, for certain persons and under certain circumstances.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_8" href="#Footnotev2_19_8"><span

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_5" id="Sidenotev2_19_5"></a> Third answer. Temperance consists in doing one&rsquo;s own business. Defended by Kritias. Sokrates pronounces it a
riddle, and refutes it. Distinction between making and doing.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Temperance consists in doing one&rsquo;s own business.&rdquo; Here we have a third explanation, proposed by Charmides and presently espoused by Kritias. Sokrates professes not to understand
it, and pronounces it to be like a riddle.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_9" href="#Footnotev2_19_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> Every tradesman or artisan does the business of others as well as his own.
Are we to say for that reason that he is not temperate? I distinguish (says Kritias) between <i>making</i> and <i>doing</i>: the artisan <i>makes</i> for others, but he does not <i>do</i> for others,
and often cannot be said to <i>do</i> at all. <i>To do</i>, implies honourable, profitable, good, occupation: this alone is a man&rsquo;s own business, and this I call temperance. When a man acts so
as to harm himself, he does not do his own business.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_10" href="#Footnotev2_19_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> The doing of good things, is temperance.<a name=

<p>There is here a good deal of playful vivacity in the dialogue: Charmid&ecirc;s gives this last answer, which he has heard from Kritias, who is at first not forward to defend it, until Charmides
forces him to come forward, by hints and side-insinuations. This is the dramatic art and variety of Plato, charming to read, but not bearing upon him as a philosopher.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_6" id="Sidenotev2_19_6"></a> Fourth answer, by Kritias. Temperance consists in self-knowledge.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Perhaps it is. But does the well-doer always and certainly know that he is doing well? Does the temperate man know his own temperance? <i>Krit.</i> &mdash; He certainly must.
Indeed I think that the essence of temperance is, <i>Self-knowledge</i>. <i>Know thyself</i> is the precept of the Delphian God, who means thereby the same as if he had said &mdash; Be temperate. I
now put aside all that I have said before, and take up this new position, That temperance consists in a man&rsquo;s knowing himself. If you do not admit it, I challenge your cross-examination.<a

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; I cannot tell you whether I admit it or not, until I have investigated. You address me as if I professed to know the subject: but it is because I do not know, that I examine,
in conjunction with you, each successive answer.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_13" href="#Footnotev2_19_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> If temperance <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page156" id=
"v2page156"></a>156</span>consists in knowing, it must be a knowledge of something. <i>Krit.</i> &mdash; It is so: it is knowledge of a man&rsquo;s self. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What good does this
knowledge procure for us? as medical knowledge procures for us health &mdash; architectural knowledge, buildings, &amp;c.? <i>Krit.</i> &mdash; It has no object positive result of analogous character:
but neither have arithmetic nor geometry. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; True, but in arithmetic and geometry, we can at least indicate a something known, distinct from the knowledge. Number and proportion are
distinct from arithmetic, the science which takes cognizance of them. Now what is that, of which temperance is the knowledge, &mdash; distinct from temperance itself? <i>Krit.</i> &mdash; It is on
this very point that temperance differs from all the other cognitions. Each of the others is knowledge of something different from itself, but not knowledge of itself: while temperance is knowledge
of all the other sciences and of itself also.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_14" href="#Footnotev2_19_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If this be so, it will of course be a knowledge of

knowledge of knowledge is impossible.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; According to your explanation, then, it is only the temperate man who knows himself. He alone is able to examine himself, and thus to find out what he really knows and does
not know: he alone is able to examine others, and thus to find out what each man knows, or what each man only believes himself to know without really knowing. Temperance, or self-knowledge, is the
knowledge what a man knows, and what he does not know.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_15" href="#Footnotev2_19_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Now two questions arise upon this: First, is it possible for a
man to know, that he knows what he does know, and that he does not know what he does not know? Next, granting it to be possible, in what way do we gain by it? The first of these two questions
involves much difficulty. How can there be any cognition, which is not cognition of a given <i>cognitum</i>, but cognition merely of other cognitions and non-cognitions? There is no vision except of
some colour, no audition except of some sound: there can be no vision of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page157" id="v2page157"></a>157</span>visions, or audition of auditions. So likewise, all
desire is desire of some pleasure; there is no desire of desires. All volition is volition of some good; there is no volition of volitions: all love applies to something beautiful &mdash; there is no
love of other loves. The like is true of fear, opinion, &amp;c. It would be singular therefore, if contrary to all these analogies, there were any cognition not of some <i>cognitum</i>, but of itself
and other cognitions.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_16" href="#Footnotev2_19_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

heavier, lighter: there is always a something distinct, to which reference is made. Vision does not include in itself both the property of seeing, and that of being seen: the <i>videns</i> is

<p>In all these cases (concludes Sokrates) the characteristic property is essentially relative, implying something distinguishable from, yet correlating with, itself. May we generalise the
proposition, and affirm, That all properties are relative, and that every thing in nature has its characteristic property with reference, not to itself, but to something else? Or is this true only of
some things and not of all &mdash; so that cognition may be something in the latter category?</p>

<p>This is an embarrassing question, which I do not feel qualified to decide: neither the general question, whether there be any cases of characteristic properties having no reference to any thing
beyond themselves, and therefore not relative, but absolute &mdash; nor the particular question, whether cognition be one of those cases, implying no separate <i>cognitum</i>, but being itself both

<p>Let us concede for the present discussion (continues Sokrates) that cognition of cognition is possible. Still how does this prove that there can be cognition of non-cognition? that a man can know
both what he knows and what he does not know? For this is what we declared self-knowledge and temperance to be.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_20" href="#Footnotev2_19_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> To
have cognition of cognition is one thing: to have cognition of non-cognition is a different thing, not necessarily connected with it. If you have cognition of cognition, you will be enabled to
distinguish that which is cognition from that which is not &mdash; but no more. Now the knowledge or ignorance of the matter of health is known by medical science: that of justice known by political
science. The knowledge of knowledge simply &mdash; cognition of cognition &mdash; is different from both. The person who possesses this last only, without knowing either medicine or politics, will
become aware that he knows something and possesses some sort of knowledge, and will be able to verify so much with regard to others. But <i>what</i> it is that he himself knows, or that others know,
he will not thereby be enabled to find out: he will not distinguish whether that which is known belong to physiology or to politics; to do this, special acquirements are needed. You, a temperate man
therefore, as such, do not know <i>what</i> you know and <i>what</i> you do not know; you know the bare fact, <i>that</i> you know and <i>that</i> you do not know. You will not be competent to
cross-examine any one who professes to know medicine or any other particular subject, so as to ascertain whether the man really possesses what he pretends to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page159"

that you are ignorant:&mdash; no one can do it except some fellow <i>expert</i>. You can ascertain that he possesses some knowledge: but whether he possesses that particular knowledge to which he
lays claim, or whether he falsely pretends to it, you cannot ascertain:&mdash; since, as a temperate man, you know only cognition and non-cognition generally. To ascertain this point, you must be not
only a temperate man, but a man of special cognition besides.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_21" href="#Footnotev2_19_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> You can question and test no one, except another

<p>But if this be all that temperance can do, of what use is it to us (continues Sokrates)? It is indeed a great benefit to know how much we know, and how much we do not know: it is also a great
benefit to know respecting others, how much <i>they</i> know, and how much they do not know. If thus instructed, we should make fewer mistakes: we should do by ourselves only what we knew how to do,
&mdash; we should commit to others that which they knew how to do, and which we did not know. But temperance (meaning thereby cognition of cognition and of non-cognition generally) does not confer
such instruction, nor have we found any science which does.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_22" href="#Footnotev2_19_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> How temperance benefits us, does not yet appear.</p>

might exist cognition of cognition, though our discussion tended to negative such a possibility. We have farther granted, that this cognition of cognition, or science of science, might know all the
operations of each separate and special science: so that the temperate man (<i>i.e.</i> he who possesses cognition of cognition) might know both what he knows and what he does not know: might know,
namely, that he knows the former and that he does not know the latter. We have granted this, though it is really an absurdity to say, that what a man does not know at all, he nevertheless does know

<p>Here ends the dialogue called Charmid&ecirc;s<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_32" href="#Footnotev2_19_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> after the interchange of a few concluding compliments, forming <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page163" id="v2page163"></a>163</span>part of the great dramatic richness which characterises this dialogue from the beginning. I make no attempt to reproduce this latter
attribute; though it is one of the peculiar merits of Plato in reference to ethical enquiry, imparting to the subject a charm which does not naturally belong to it. I confine myself to the
philosophical bearing of the dialogue. According to the express declaration of Sokrates, it ends in nothing but disappointment. No positive result is attained. The problem &mdash; What is Temperance?
&mdash; remains unsolved, after four or five different solutions have been successively tested and repudiated.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_19" id="Sidenotev2_19_19"></a> The Charmides is an excellent specimen of Dialogues of Search. Abundance of guesses and tentatives, all ultimately
disallowed.</span></p>

<p>The Charmid&ecirc;s (like the Lach&ecirc;s) is a good illustrative specimen of those Dialogues of Search, the general character and purpose of which I have explained in my eighth chapter. It proves nothing: it disproves several hypotheses: but it exhibits (and therein
consists its value) the anticipating, guessing, tentative, and eliminating process, without which no defensible conclusions can be obtained &mdash; without which, even if such be found, no advocate
can be formed capable of defending them against an acute cross-examiner. In most cases, this tentative process is forgotten or ignored: even when recognised as a reality, it is set aside with
indifference, often with ridicule. A writer who believes himself to have solved any problem, publishes his solution together with the proofs; and acquires deserved credit for it, if those proofs give
satisfaction. But he does not care to preserve, nor do the public care to know, the steps by which such solution has been reached. Nevertheless in most cases, and in all cases involving much
difficulty, there has been a process, more or less tedious, of tentative and groping &mdash; of guesses at first hailed as promising, then followed out to a certain extent, lastly discovered to be
untenable. The history of science,<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_33" href="#Footnotev2_19_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> astronomical, physical, chemical, physiological, &amp;c., <span class="pagenum"><a
name="v2page164" id="v2page164"></a>164</span>wherever it has been at all recorded, attests this constant antecedence of a period of ignorance, confusion, and dispute, even in cases where ultimately
a solution has been found commanding the nearly unanimous adhesion of the scientific world. But on subjects connected with man and society, this period of dispute and confusion continues to the
present moment. No unanimity has ever been approached, among nations at once active in intellect and enjoying tolerable liberty of dissent. Moreover &mdash; apart from the condition of different
sciences among mature men &mdash; we must remember that the transitive process, above described, represents the successive stages by which every adult mind has been gradually built up from infancy.
Trial and error &mdash; alternate guess and rejection, generation and destruction of sentiments and beliefs &mdash; is among the most widespread facts of human intelligence.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_34"
href="#Footnotev2_19_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> Even those ordinary minds, which in mature life harden with the most exemplary fidelity into the locally prevalent type of orthodoxy, &mdash;
have all in their earlier years gone through that semi-fluid and indeterminate period, in which the type to come is yet a matter of doubt &mdash; in which the head might have been permanently
lengthened or permanently flattened, according to the direction in which pressure was applied.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_19_33" id="Footnotev2_19_33"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_19_33">33</a></span> It is not often that historians of science take much pains to preserve
and bring together the mistaken guesses and tentatives which have preceded great physical discoveries. One instance in which this has been ably and carefully done is in the &lsquo;Biography of
Cavendish,&rsquo; the chemist and natural philosopher, by Dr. Geo. Wilson.</p>

<p>The great chemical discovery of the composition of water, accomplished during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, has been claimed as the privilege of three eminent scientific men &mdash;
Cavendish, Watt, and Lavoisier. The controversy on the subject, voluminous and bitter, has been the means of recording each successive scientific phase and point of view. It will be found admirably
expounded in this biography. Wilson sets forth the misconceptions, confusion of ideas, approximations to truth seen but not followed out, &amp;c., which prevailed upon the scientific men of that day,
especially under the misleading influence of the &ldquo;phlogiston theory,&rdquo; then universally received.</p>

<p>To Plato such a period of mental confusion would have been in itself an interesting object for contemplation and description. He might have dramatised it under the names of various disputants,
with the cross-examining Elenchus, personified in Sokrates, introduced to stir up the debate, either by first advocating, then refuting, a string of successive guesses and dreams (Charmid&ecirc;s,
173 A) of his own, or by exposing similar suggestions emanating from others; especially in regard to the definition of <i>phlogiston</i>, an entity which then overspread and darkened all chemical
speculation, but which every theorist thought himself obliged to define. The dialogues would have ended (as the Protagoras, Lysis, Charmid&ecirc;s, &amp;c., now end) by Sokrates deriding the ill
success which had attended them in the search for an explanation, and by his pointing out that while all the theorists talked familiarly about <i>phlogiston</i> as a powerful agent, none of them
could agree what it was.</p>

part of the mental process. Sokrates accepts for himself the condition of conscious ignorance.</span></p>

<p>We shall follow Plato towards the close of his career (Treatise De Legibus), into an imperative and stationary orthodoxy<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page165" id="v2page165"></a>165</span> of
his own: but in the dialogues which I have already reviewed, as well as in several others which I shall presently notice, no mention is made of any given affirmative doctrine as indispensable to
arrive at ultimately. Plato here concentrates his attention upon the indeterminate period of the mind: looking upon the mind not as an empty vessel, requiring to be filled by ready-made matter from
without &mdash; nor as a blank sheet, awaiting a foreign hand to write characters upon it &mdash; but as an assemblage of latent capacities, which must be called into action by stimulus and example,
but which can only attain improvement through multiplied trials and multiplied failures. Whereas in most cases these failures are forgotten, the peculiarity of Plato consists in his bringing them to
view with full detail, explaining the reasons of each. He illustrates abundantly, and dramatises with the greatest vivacity, the intellectual process whereby opinions are broached, at first adopted,
then mistrusted, unmade, and re-made &mdash; or perhaps not re-made at all, but exchanged for a state of conscious ignorance. The great hero and operator in this process is the Platonic Sokrates, who
accepts for himself this condition of conscious ignorance, and even makes it a matter of comparative pride, that he stands nearly alone in such confession.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_35" href=
"#Footnotev2_19_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> His colloquial influence, working powerfully and almost preternaturally,<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_36" href="#Footnotev2_19_36"><span class=
"sp">36</span></a> not only serves both to spur and to direct the activity of hearers still youthful and undecided, but also exposes those who have already made up their minds and confidently believe
themselves to know. Sokrates brings back these latter from the false persuasion of knowledge to the state of conscious ignorance, and to the prior indeterminate condition of mind, in which their
opinions have again to be put together by the tentative and guessing process. This tentative process, prosecuted under the drill of Sokrates, is in itself full of charm and interest for Plato,
whether it ends by finding a good solution or only by discarding a bad one.</p>

<p>The Charmid&ecirc;s is one of the many Platonic dialogues wherein <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page166" id="v2page166"></a>166</span>such intellectual experimentation appears depicted without any
positive result: except as it adds fresh matter to illustrate that wide-spread mental fact, &mdash; (which has already come before the reader, in Euthyphron, Alkibiad&ecirc;s, Hippias, Erast&aelig;,
Lach&ecirc;s, &amp;c., as to holiness, beauty, philosophy, courage, &amp;c., and is now brought to view in the case of <i>temperance</i> also; all of them words in every one&rsquo;s mouth, and tacitly
assumed by every one as known quantities) the perpetual and confident judgments which mankind are in the habit of delivering &mdash; their apportionment of praise and blame, as well as of reward and
punishment consequent on praise and blame &mdash; without any better basis than that of strong emotion imbibed they know not how, and without being able to render any rational explanation even of the
familiar words round which such emotions are grouped. No philosopher has done so much as Plato to depict in detail this important fact &mdash; the habitual condition of human society, modern as well
as ancient, and for that very reason generally unnoticed.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_37" href="#Footnotev2_19_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> The emotional or subjective value of temperance is all that

indeed Plato is not always consistent with himself: for we shall come to other dialogues wherein he professes himself incompetent to say whether a thing be beautiful or not, until it be determined

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_22" id="Sidenotev2_19_22"></a> Different ethical points of view in different Platonic dialogues.</span></p>

<p>Among the various unsuccessful definitions of temperance propounded, there is more than one which affords farther example to show how differently Plato deals with the same subject in different
dialogues. Here we have the phrase &mdash; &ldquo;to do one&rsquo;s own business&rdquo; &mdash; treated as an unmeaning puzzle, and exhibited as if it were analogous to various other phrases, with
which the analogy is more verbal than real. But in the Republic, Plato admits this phrase as well understood, and sets it forth as the constituent element of justice; in the Gorgias, as the leading
mark of philosophical life.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_40" href="#Footnotev2_19_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_23" id="Sidenotev2_19_23"></a> Self-knowledge is here declared to be impossible.</span></p>

<p>Again, another definition given by Kritias is, That temperance consists in knowing yourself, or in self-knowledge. In commenting upon this definition, Sokrates makes out &mdash; first, that
self-knowledge is impossible: next, that if possible, it would be useless. You cannot know yourself, he argues: you cannot know what you know, and what you do not know: to say that you know what you
know, is either tautological or untrue &mdash; to say that you know what you do not know, is a contradiction. All cognition must be cognition of something distinct from yourself: it is a relative
term which must have some correlate, and cannot be its own correlate: you cannot have cognition of cognition, still less cognition of non-cognition.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_24" id="Sidenotev2_19_24"></a> In other dialogues, Sokrates declares self-knowledge to be essential and inestimable. Necessity for the student to have
presented to him dissentient points of view.</span></p>

<p>This is an important point of view, which I shall discuss more at length when I come to the Platonic The&aelig;tetus. I bring it to view here only as contrasting with different language held by
the Platonic Sokrates in other dialogues; where he insists on the great value and indispensable necessity of self-knowledge, as a preliminary to all other knowledge &mdash; upon the duty of
eradicating from men&rsquo;s minds that false persuasion of their own knowledge which they universally cherished<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page168" id="v2page168"></a>168</span> &mdash; and
upon the importance of forcing them to know their own ignorance as well as their own knowledge. In the face of this last purpose, so frequently avowed by the Platonic Sokrates (indirectly even in
this very dialogue),<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_41" href="#Footnotev2_19_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> we remark a material discrepancy, when he here proclaims self-knowledge to be impossible. We
must judge every dialogue by itself, illustrating it when practicable by comparison with others, but not assuming consistence between them as a postulate <i>&agrave; priori</i>. It is a part of
Plato&rsquo;s dramatic and tentative mode of philosophising to work out different ethical points of view, and to have present to his mind one or other of them, with peculiar force in each different
dialogue. The subject is thus brought before us on all its sides, and the reader is familiarised with what a dialectician might say, whether capable of being refuted or not. Inconsistency between one
dialogue and another is not a fault in the Platonic dialogues of Search; but is, on the contrary, a part of the training process, for any student who is destined to acquire that full mastery of
question and answer which Plato regards as the characteristic test of knowledge. It is a puzzle and provocative to the internal meditation of the student.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_25" id="Sidenotev2_19_25"></a> Courage and Temperance are shown to have no distinct meaning, except as founded on the general cognizance of good and
evil.</span></p>

<p>In analyzing the Lach&ecirc;s, we observed that the definition of courage given by Nikias was shown by Sokrates to have no meaning, except in so far as it coincided with the general knowledge or
cognition of good and evil. Here, too, in the Charmid&ecirc;s, we are brought in the last result to the same terminus &mdash; the general cognition of good and evil. But Temperance, as previously
good and defined, is not comprehended under that cognition, and is therefore pronounced to be unprofitable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_26" id="Sidenotev2_19_26"></a> Distinction made between the special sciences and the science of Good and Evil. Without this last, the special sciences
are of no use.</span></p>

<p>This cognition of good and evil &mdash; the science of the profitable &mdash; is here (in the Charmid&ecirc;s) proclaimed by Sokrates to have a place of its own among the other sciences; and even
to be first among them, essentially necessary to supervise and direct them, as it had been declared in Alkibiad&ecirc;s II. Now the same supervising place and directorship had been claimed by <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page169" id="v2page169"></a>169</span>Kritias for Temperance as he defines it &mdash; that is, self-knowledge, or the cognition of our cognitions and non-cognitions. But
Sokrates doubts even the reality of such self-knowledge: and granting for argument&rsquo;s sake that it exists, he still does not see how it can be profitable. For the utmost which its supervision
can ensure would be, that each description of work shall be scientifically done, by the skilful man, and not by the unskilful. But it is not true, absolutely speaking (he argues), that acting
scientifically or with knowledge is sufficient for well doing or for happiness: for the question must next be asked &mdash; Knowledge &mdash; of what? Not knowledge of leather-cutting,
carpenter&rsquo;s or brazier&rsquo;s work, arithmetic, or even medicine: these, and many others, a man may possess, and may act according to them; but still he will not attain the end of being happy.
All cognitions contribute in greater or less proportion towards that end: but what contributes most, and most essentially, is the cognition of good and evil, without which all the rest are
insufficient. Of this last-mentioned cognition or science, it is the special object to ensure profit or benefit:<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_42" href="#Footnotev2_19_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> to
take care that everything done by the other sciences shall be done well or in a manner conducing towards the end Happiness. After this, there is no province left for temperance &mdash; <i>i.e.</i>,
self-knowledge, or the knowledge of cognitions and non-cognitions: no assignable way in which it can yield any benefit.<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_43" href="#Footnotev2_19_43"><span class=

<p>Two points are here to be noted, as contained and debated in the handling of this dialogue. 1. Knowledge absolutely, is a word without meaning: all knowledge is relative, and has a definite object
or <i>cognitum</i>: there can be no <i>scientia scientiarum</i>. 2. Among the various objects of knowledge (<i>cognita</i> or <i>cognoscenda</i>), one is, <i>good and evil</i>. There is a science of
good and evil, the function of which is, to watch over and compare the results of the other sciences, in order to promote results of happiness, and to prevent results of misery: without the
supervision of this latter science, the other sciences might be all <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page170" id="v2page170"></a>170</span>exactly followed out, but no rational comparison could be

relation to other Ends (Teleology): distinct from those other more special sciences, which study the means each towards a separate End of its own. Here we fall into the same track as we have already
indicated in Lach&ecirc;s and Alkibiad&ecirc;s II.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_19_28" id="Sidenotev2_19_28"></a> Courage and Temperance, handled both by Plato and by Aristotle. Comparison between the two.</span></p>

<p>These matters I shall revert to in other dialogues, where we shall find them turned over and canvassed in many different ways. One farther observation remains to be made on the Lach&ecirc;s and
Charmid&ecirc;s, discussing as they do Courage (which is also again discussed in the Protagoras) and Temperance. An interesting comparison may be made between them and the third book of the
Nikomachean Ethics of Aristotle,<a name="FnAnchorv2_19_45" href="#Footnotev2_19_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> where the same two subjects are handled in the Aristotelian manner. The direct,
didactic, systematising, brevity of Aristotle contrasts remarkably with the indirect and circuitous prolixity, the multiplied suggestive comparisons, the shifting points of view, which we find in
Plato. Each has its advantages: and both together will be found not more than sufficient, for any one who is seriously bent on acquiring what Plato calls knowledge, with the cross-examining power
included in it. Aristotle is greatly superior to Plato in one important attribute of a philosopher: in the care which he takes to discriminate the different significations of the same word: the
univocal and the equivocal, the generically identical from the remotely analogical, the proper from the improper, the literal from the metaphorical. Of such precautions we discover little or no trace
in Plato, who sometimes seems not merely to neglect, but even to deride them. Yet Aristotle, assisted as he was by all Plato&rsquo;s speculations before us, is not to be understood as having
superseded the necessity for that negative Elenchus which animates the Platonic dialogues of Search: nor would his affirmative doctrines have held their grounds before a cross-examining Sokrates.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19ap">APPENDIX</a>.</h2>

<p>The dialogue Charmid&ecirc;s is declared to be spurious, not only by Ast, but also by Socher (Ast, Platon&rsquo;s Leb. pp. 419-428; Socher, Ueber Platon, pp. 130-137). Steinhart maintains the
genuineness of the dialogue against them; declaring (as in regard to the Lach&ecirc;s) that he can hardly conceive how critics can mistake the truly Platonic character of it, though here too, as in
the Lach&ecirc;s, he detects &ldquo;adolescenti&aelig; vestigia&rdquo; (Steinhart, Einleit. zum Charmid&ecirc;s, pp. 290-293).</p>

<p>Schleiermacher considers Charmid&ecirc;s as well as Lach&ecirc;s to be appendixes to the Protagoras, which opinion both Stallbaum (Proleg. ad Charm, p. 121; Proleg. ad Lachet. p. 30, 2nd ed.) and
Steinhart controvert.</p>

<p>The views of Stallbaum respecting the Charmid&ecirc;s are declared by Steinhart (p. 290) to be &ldquo;recht &auml;usserlich und oberfl&auml;chlich&rdquo;. To me they appear much nearer the truth
than the profound and recondite meanings, the far-sighted indirect hints, which Steinhart himself perceives or supposes in the words of Plato.</p>

<p>These critics consider the dialogue as composed during the government of the Thirty at Athens, in which opinion I do not concur.</p>

<h2>LYSIS.</h2>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_20_1" id="Sidenotev2_20_1"></a> Analogy between Lysis and Charmid&ecirc;s. Richness of dramatic incident in both. Youthful beauty.</span></p>

<p>The Lysis, as well as the Charmid&ecirc;s, is a dialogue recounted by Sokrates himself, describing both incidents and a conversation in a crowded Pal&aelig;stra; wherein not merely bodily
exercises were habitually practised, but debate was carried on and intellectual instruction given by a Sophist named Mikkus, companion and admirer of Sokrates. There is a lively dramatic
commencement, introducing Sokrates into the Pal&aelig;stra, and detailing the preparation and scenic arrangements, before the real discussion opens. It is the day of the Herm&aelig;a, or festival of
Hermes, celebrated by sacrifice and its accompanying banquets among the frequenters of gymnasia.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_20_2" id="Sidenotev2_20_2"></a> Scenery and personages of the Lysis.</span></p>

<p>Lysis, like Charmid&ecirc;s, is an Athenian youth, of conspicuous beauty, modesty, and promise. His father Demokrates represents an ancient family of the &AElig;xonian Deme in Attica, and is said
to be descended from Zeus and the daughter of the Arch&ecirc;get&ecirc;s or Heroic Founder of that Deme. The family moreover are so wealthy, that they have gained many victories at the Pythian,
Isthmian, and Nemean games, both with horses and with chariots and four. Menexenus, companion of Lysis, is somewhat older, and is his affectionate friend. The persons who invite Sokrates into the
pal&aelig;stra, and give occasion to the debate, are Ktesippus and Hippothal&ecirc;s: both of them adults, yet in the vigour of age. Hippothal&ecirc;s is the Erastes of Lysis, passionately attached
to him. He is ridiculed by Ktesippus for perpetually talking about Lysis, as well as for addressing to him compositions both in prose and verse, full of praise and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page173" id="v2page173"></a>173</span>flattery; extolling not only his personal beauty, but also his splendid ancestry and position.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_1" href="#Footnotev2_20_1"><span class=
"sp">1</span></a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_20_3" id="Sidenotev2_20_3"></a> Origin of the conversation. Sokrates promises to give an example of the proper way of talking to a youth, for his
benefit.</span></p>

<p>In reference to these addresses, Sokrates remonstrates with Hippothal&ecirc;s on the imprudence and mischief of addressing to a youth flatteries calculated to turn his head. He is himself then
invited by Hippothal&ecirc;s to exhibit a specimen of the proper mode of talking to youth; such as shall be at once acceptable to the person addressed, and unobjectionable. Sokrates agrees to do so,
if an opportunity be afforded him of conversing with Lysis.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_2" href="#Footnotev2_20_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Accordingly after some well-imagined incidents, interesting
as marks of Greek manners &mdash; Sokrates and Ktesippus with others seat themselves in the pal&aelig;stra, amidst a crowd of listeners.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_3" href="#Footnotev2_20_3"><span class=
"sp">3</span></a> Lysis, too modest at first to approach, is emboldened to sit down by seeing Menexenus seated by the side of Sokrates: while Hippothal&ecirc;s, not daring to put himself where Lysis
can see him, listens, but conceals himself behind some of the crowd. Sokrates begins the conversation with Menexenus and Lysis jointly: but presently Menexenus is called away for a moment, and he
talks with Lysis singly.</p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Well &mdash; Lysis &mdash; your father and mother love you extremely. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Assuredly they do. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; They would wish you therefore to be as
happy as possible. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Undoubtedly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do you think any man happy, who is a slave, and who is not allowed to do any thing that he desires? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; I
do not think him happy at all. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Since therefore your father and mother are so anxious that you should be happy, they of course allow you to do the things which you desire, and
never reprove nor forbid you. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Not at all, by Zeus, Sokrates: there are a great many things that they forbid me. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How say you! they wish you to be happy
&mdash; and they hinder you from doing what you wish! Tell me, for example, when one of your father&rsquo;s chariots is going to run a race, if you wished to mount and take the reins, would not they
allow you to do so? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; No &mdash; certainly: they would not allow me. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But whom do they allow, then? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; My father employs a paid charioteer.
<i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What! do they permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page174" id="v2page174"></a>174</span> a hireling, in preference to <i>you</i>, to do what he wishes with the horses? and do
they give him pay besides for doing so? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Why &mdash; to be sure. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But doubtless, I imagine, they trust the team of mules to your direction; and if you chose
to take the whip and flog, they would allow you? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Allow me? not at all. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What! is no one allowed to flog them? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Yes &mdash; certainly
&mdash; the mule-groom. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Is he a slave or free? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; A slave. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then, it seems, they esteem a slave higher than you their son; trusting their
property to him rather than to you, letting <i>him</i> do what he pleases, while they forbid you. But tell me farther: do they allow you to direct yourself &mdash; or do not they even trust you so
far as that? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; How can you imagine that they trust me? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But does any one else direct you? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Yes &mdash; this tutor here. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; Is he a slave? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; To be sure: belonging to our family. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; That is shocking: one of free birth to be under the direction of a slave! But what is it that he
does, as your director? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; He conducts me to my teacher&rsquo;s house. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What! do <i>they</i> govern you also, these teachers? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Undoubtedly
they do. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then your father certainly is bent on putting over you plenty of directors and governors. But surely, when you come home to your mother, she at least, anxious that you
should be happy as far as she is concerned, lets you do what you please about the wool or the web, when she is weaving: she does not forbid you to meddle with the bodkin or any of the other
instruments of her work? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Ridiculous! not only does she forbid me, but I should be beaten if I did meddle. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How is this, by Herakl&ecirc;s? Have you done any
wrong to your father and mother? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Never at all, by Zeus. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; From what provocation is it, then, that they prevent you in this terrible way, from being happy and
doing what you wish? keeping you the whole day in servitude to some one, and never your own master? so that you derive no benefit either from the great wealth of the family, which is managed by every
one else rather than by you &mdash; or from your own body, noble as it is. Even <i>that</i> is consigned to the watch and direction of another: while you, Lysis, are master of nothing, nor can do any
one thing of what you desire. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; The reason is, Sokrates, that I am not yet old enough. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; That can hardly be the reason; for to a certain extent your father and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page175" id="v2page175"></a>175</span>mother do trust you, without waiting for you to grow older. If they want any thing to be written or read for them, they employ
you for that purpose in preference to any one in the house: and you are then allowed to write or read first, whichever of the letters you think proper. Again, when you take up the lyre, neither
father nor mother hinder you from tightening or relaxing the strings, or striking them either with your finger or with the plectrum. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; They do not. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Why is it,
then, that they do not hinder you in this last case, as they did in the cases before mentioned? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; I suppose it is because I know this last, but did not know the others. <i>
Sokr.</i> &mdash; Well, my good friend, you see that it is not your increase of years that your father waits for; but on the very day that he becomes convinced that you know better than he, he will
entrust both himself and his property to your management. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; I suppose that he will. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Ay &mdash; and your neighbour too will judge in the same way as your
father. As soon as he is satisfied that you understand house-management better than he does, which do you think he will rather do &mdash; confide his house to you, or continue to manage it himself?
<i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; I think he will confide it to me. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The Athenians too: do not you think that they also will put their affairs into your management, as soon as they perceive
that you have intelligence adequate to the task? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Yes: I do. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What do you say about the Great King also, by Zeus! When his meat is being boiled, would he
permit his eldest son who is to succeed to the rule of Asia, to throw in any thing that he pleases into the sauce, rather than us, if we come and prove to him that we know better than his son the way
of preparing sauce? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Clearly, he will rather permit us. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The Great King will not let his son throw in even a pinch of salt: while we, if we chose to take up
an entire handful, should be allowed to throw it in. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; No doubt. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What if his son has a complaint in his eyes; would the Great King, knowing him to be ignorant
of medicine, allow him even to touch his own eyes or would he forbid him? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; He would forbid him. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; As to us, on the contrary, if he accounted us good
physicians, and if we desired even to open the eyes and drop a powder into them, he would not hinder us, in the conviction that we understood what we were doing. <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page176" id="v2page176"></a>176</span>You speak truly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; All other matters, in short, on which he believed us to be wiser than himself or his son, he would
entrust to us rather than to himself or his son? <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Necessarily so, Sokrates. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; This is the state of the case, then, my dear Lysis: On those matters on which we
shall have become intelligent, all persons will put trust in us &mdash; Greeks as well as barbarians, men as well as women. We shall do whatever we please respecting them: no one will be at all
inclined to interfere with us on such matters; not only we shall be ourselves free, but we shall have command over others besides. These matters will be really ours, because we shall derive real good
from them.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_4" href="#Footnotev2_20_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> As to those subjects, on the contrary, on which we shall not have acquired intelligence, no one will trust us
to do what we think right: every one, &mdash; not merely strangers, but father and mother and nearer relatives if there were any, &mdash; will obstruct us as much as they can: we shall be in
servitude so far as these subjects are concerned; and they will be really alien to us, for we shall derive no real good from them. Do you admit that this is the case?<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_5" href=
"#Footnotev2_20_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; I do admit it. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Shall we then be friends to any one, or will any one love us, on those matters on which we
are unprofitable <i>Lysis.</i> &mdash; Certainly not. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You see that neither does your father love you, nor does any man love another, in so far as he is useless? <i>Lysis.</i>
&mdash; Apparently not. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If then you become intelligent, my boy, all persons will be your friends and all persons will be your kinsmen: for you will be useful and good: if you do
not, no one will be your friend, &mdash; not even your father nor your mother nor your other relatives.</p>

tell him yourself (replies Sokrates) what you have heard from me: you listened very attentively. Most certainly I shall tell him (says Lysis): but meanwhile pray address to him yourself some other

manner.</span></p>

<p>I have given at length, and almost literally (with some few abbreviations), this first conversation between Sokrates and Lysis, because it is a very characteristic passage, exhibiting
conspicuously several peculiar features of the Platonico-Sokratic interrogation. Facts common and familiar are placed in a novel point of view, ingeniously contrasted, and introduced as
stepping-stones to a very wide generality. Wisdom or knowledge is exalted into the ruling force with liberty of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page178" id="v2page178"></a>178</span>action not
admissible except under its guidance: the questions are put in an inverted half-ironical tone (not uncommon with the historical Sokrates<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_9" href="#Footnotev2_20_9"><span class=
"sp">9</span></a>), as if an affirmative answer were expected as a matter of course, while in truth the answer is sure to be negative: lastly, the purpose of checking undue self-esteem is proclaimed.
The rest of the dialogue, which contains the main substantive question investigated, I can report only in brief abridgment, with a few remarks following.</p>

dialogue.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates begins, as Lysis requests, to interrogate Menexenus &mdash; first premising &mdash; Different men have different tastes: some love horses and dogs, others wealth or honours. For my part,
I care little about all such acquisitions: but I ardently desire to possess friends, and I would rather have a good friend than all the treasures of Persia. You two, Menexenus and Lysis, are much to
be envied, because at your early age, each of you has made an attached friend of the other. But I am so far from any such good fortune, that I do not even know how any man becomes the friend of
another. This is what I want to ask from you, Menexenus, as one who must know,<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_10" href="#Footnotev2_20_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> having acquired such a friend
already.</p>

</div>

<p>When one man loves another, which becomes the friend of which? Does he who loves, become the friend of him whom he loves, whether the latter returns the affection or not? Or is the person loved,
whatever be his own dispositions, the friend of the person who loves him? Or is reciprocity of affection necessary, in order that either shall be the friend of the other?</p>

<p>The speakers cannot satisfy themselves that the title of <i>friend</i> fits either of the three cases;<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_11" href="#Footnotev2_20_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> so that
this line of interrogating comes to a dead lock. Menexenus avows his embarrassment, while Lysis expresses himself more hopefully.</p>

<p>Sokrates now takes up a different aspect of the question, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page179" id="v2page179"></a>179</span>turns to Lysis, inviting him to consider what has been laid
down by the poets, &ldquo;our fathers and guides in respect of wisdom&rdquo;.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_12" href="#Footnotev2_20_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Homer says that the Gods originate
friendship, by bringing the like man to his like: Empedokles and other physical philosophers have also asserted, that like must always and of necessity be the friend of like. These wise teachers
cannot mean (continues Sokrates) that bad men are friends of each other. The bad man can be no one&rsquo;s friend. He is not even like himself, but ever wayward and insane:&mdash; much less can he be
like to any one else, even to another bad man. They mean that the good alone are like to each other, and friends to each other.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_13" href="#Footnotev2_20_13"><span class=

reciprocal aid? Is not the good man, so far forth as good, sufficient to himself, &mdash; standing in need of no one &mdash; and therefore loving no one? How can good men care much for each other,
seeing that they thus neither regret each other when absent, nor have need of each other when present?<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_14" href="#Footnotev2_20_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a></p>

Rejected.</span></p>

<p>It appears, therefore, Lysis (continues Sokrates), that we are travelling in the wrong road, and must try another direction. I now remember to have recently heard some one affirming &mdash;
contrary to what we have just said &mdash; that likeness is a cause of aversion, <span class="correction" title="amended from aud">and</span> unlikeness a cause of friendship. He too produced
evidence from the poets: for Hesiod tells us, that &ldquo;potter is jealous of potter, and bard of bard&rdquo;. Things most alike are most full of envy, jealousy and hatred to each other: things most
unlike, are most full of friendship. Thus the poor man is of necessity a friend to the rich, the weak man to the strong, for the sake of protection: the sick man, for similar reason, to the
physician. In general, every ignorant man loves, and is a friend to, the man of knowledge. Nay, there are <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page180" id="v2page180"></a>180</span>also physical
philosophers, who assert that this principle pervades all nature; that dry is the friend of moist, cold of hot, and so forth: that all contraries serve as nourishment to their contraries. These are
ingenious teachers: but if we follow them, we shall have the cleverest disputants attacking us immediately, and asking &mdash; What! is the opposite essentially a friend to its opposite? Do you mean
that unjust is essentially the friend of just &mdash; temperate of intemperate &mdash; good of evil? Impossible: the doctrine cannot be maintained.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_15" href=

<p>My head turns (continues Sokrates) with this confusion and puzzle &mdash; since neither like is the friend of like, nor contrary of contrary. But I will now hazard a different guess of my own.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_20_16" href="#Footnotev2_20_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> There are three genera in all: the good &mdash; the evil &mdash; and that which is neither good nor evil, the
indifferent. Now we have found that good is not a friend to good &mdash; nor evil to evil &mdash; nor good to evil &mdash; nor evil to good. If therefore there exist any friendship at all, it must be
the indifferent that is friend, either to its like, or to the good: for nothing whatever can be a friend to evil. But if the indifferent be a friend at all, it cannot be a friend to its own like;
since we have already shown that like generally is not friend to like. It remains therefore, that the indifferent, in itself neither good nor evil, is friend to the good.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_17"

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_20_12" id="Sidenotev2_20_12"></a> Suggestion canvassed. If the Indifferent is friend to the Good, it is determined to become so by the contact of felt
evil, from which it is anxious to escape.</span></p>

<p>Yet hold! Are we on the right scent? What reason is there to determine, on the part of the indifferent, attachment to the good? It will only have such attachment under certain given circumstances:
when, though neither good nor evil in itself, it has nevertheless evil associated with it, of which it desires to be rid. Thus the body in itself is neither good nor evil: but when diseased, it has
evil clinging to it, and becomes in consequence of this evil, friendly to the medical art as a remedy. But this is true only so long as the evil is only apparent, and not real: so long as it is a
mere superficial appendage, and has not become incorporated with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page181" id="v2page181"></a>181</span>essential nature of the body. When evil has become
engrained, the body ceases to be indifferent (<i>i.e.</i>, neither good nor evil), and loses all its attachment to good. Thus that which determines the indifferent to become friend of the good, is,
the contact and pressure of accessory evil not in harmony with its own nature, accompanied by a desire for the cure of such evil.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_18" href="#Footnotev2_20_18"><span class=

and Menexenus, our wealth is all a dream! we have been yielding again to delusions! Let us once more examine. You will admit that all friendship is on account of something and for the sake of
something: it is relative both to some producing cause, and to some prospective end. Thus the body, which is in itself neither good nor evil, becomes when sick a friend to the medical art: on account
of sickness, which is an evil &mdash; and for the sake of health, which is a good. The medical art is dear to us, because health is dear: but is there any thing behind, for <span class="pagenum"><a
name="v2page182" id="v2page182"></a>182</span>the sake of which health also is dear? It is plain that we cannot push the series of references onward for ever, and that we must come ultimately to
something which is dear <i>per se</i>, not from reference to any ulterior <i>aliud</i>. We must come to some <i>primum amabile</i>, dear by its own nature, to which all other dear things refer, and
from which they are derivatives.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_20" href="#Footnotev2_20_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> It is this <i>primum amabile</i> which is the primitive, essential, and constant,
object of our affections: we love other things only from their being associated with it. Thus suppose a father tenderly attached to his son, and that the son has drunk hemlock, for which wine is an
antidote; the father will come by association to prize highly, not merely the wine which saves his son&rsquo;s life, but even the cup in which the wine is contained. Yet it would be wrong to say that
he prizes the wine or the cup as much as his son: for the truth is, that all his solicitude is really on behalf of his son, and extends only in a derivative and secondary way to the wine and the cup.
So about gold and silver: we talk of prizing highly gold and silver &mdash; but this is incorrect, for what we really prize is not gold, but the ulterior something, whatever it be, for the attainment
of which gold and other instrumental means are accumulated. In general terms &mdash; when we say that B is dear on account of A, we are really speaking of A under the name of B. What is really dear,
is that primitive object of love, <i>primum amabile</i>, towards which all the affections which we bear to other things, refer and tend.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_21" href="#Footnotev2_20_21"><span

<p>Is it then true (continues Sokrates) that good is our <i>primum amabile</i>, and dear to us in itself? If so, is it dear to us on account of evil? that is, only as a remedy for evil; so that if
evil were totally banished, good would cease to be prized? Is it true that evil is the cause why any thing is dear to us?<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_22" href="#Footnotev2_20_22"><span class=

neither good nor evil, would still remain: and the things which gratify those appetites will be dear to us. It is not therefore true that evil is the cause of things being dear to us. We have just
found out another cause for loving and being loved &mdash; desire. He who desires, loves what he desires and as long as he desires: he desires moreover that of which he is in want, and he is in want
of that which has been taken away from him &mdash; of his own.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_23" href="#Footnotev2_20_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> It is therefore this <i>own</i> which is the
appropriate object of desire, friendship, and love. If you two, Lysis and Menexenus, love each other, it is because you are somehow of kindred nature with each other. The lover would not become a
lover, unless there were, between him and his beloved, a certain kinship or affinity in mind, disposition, tastes, or form. We love, by necessary law, that which has a natural affinity to us; so that
the real and genuine lover may be certain of a return of affection from his beloved.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_24" href="#Footnotev2_20_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a></p>

confusion between &tau;&#8056; &delta;&iota;&#940; &tau;&iota; and &tau;&#8056; &#7957;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&#940; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;, which two he began by carefully distinguishing. Thus in 218
D he says, &#8001; &phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; &#7952;&sigma;&tau;&#8054; &tau;&#8179; &phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; &mdash; &#7957;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&#940; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &delta;&iota;&#940; &tau;&iota;. Again 219 A, he says &mdash; &tau;&#8056; &sigma;&#8182;&mu;&alpha; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &#7984;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8134;&sigmaf;
&phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&nu; &#7952;&sigma;&tau;&#943;&nu;, <span class="gesp">&delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&#8052;&nu; &nu;&#972;&sigma;&omicron;&nu;, &#7957;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha;
&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &#8017;&gamma;&iota;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>. This is a very clear and important distinction.</p>

<p>It is continued in 220 D &mdash; &#8005;&tau;&iota; <span class="gesp">&delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&#8056; &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#8056;&nu;</span> &tau;&#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#8056;&nu;

&nu;&#972;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;. But in 220 E &mdash; &tau;&#8056; &delta;&#8050; &tau;&#8183; &#8004;&nu;&tau;&iota; &phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&nu; &pi;&#8118;&nu;
&tau;&omicron;&#8016;&nu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&#943;&omicron;&nu; &tau;&omicron;&#973;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &phi;&alpha;&#943;&nu;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;

&#8003;&nu; &#7953;&chi;&theta;&rho;&omicron;&#8166; &#7957;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha;</span>. To make the reasoning consistent with what had gone before, these two last words ought to be exchanged
for &delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&#8056; &#7952;&chi;&theta;&rho;&#972;&nu;. Plato had laid down the doctrine that good is loved &mdash; &delta;&iota;&#8048; &tau;&#8056;
&kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#972;&nu;, not &#7957;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&alpha; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&#8166;. Good is loved on <i>account of evil</i>, but for <i>the sake of
obtaining</i> a remedy to or cessation of the evil.</p>

<p>Steinhart (in his note on Hieron. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s translation of Plato, p. 268) calls this a &ldquo;sophistisches R&auml;thselspiel&rdquo;; and he notes other portions of the dialogue which
&ldquo;remind us of the deceptive tricks of the Sophists&rdquo; (die Trugspiele der Sophisten, see p. 222-224-227-230). He praises Plato here for his &ldquo;fine pleasantry on the deceptive arts of
the Sophists&rdquo;. Admitting that Plato puts forward sophistical quibbles with the word &phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;, he tells us that this is suitable for the purpose of puzzling the
contentious young man Menexenus. The confusion between &#7957;&nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&#940; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon; and &delta;&iota;&#940; &tau;&iota; (noticed above) appears to be numbered by
Steinhart among the fine jests against Protagoras, Prodikus, or some of the Sophists. I can see nothing in it except an unconscious inaccuracy in Plato&rsquo;s reasoning.</p>

knowledge.</span></p>

<p>Thus ends the main discussion of the Lysis: not only without any positive result, but with speakers and hearers more puzzled than they were at the beginning: having been made to feel a great many
difficulties which they never felt before. Nor can I perceive any general purpose running through the dialogue, except that truly Sokratic and Platonic purpose &mdash; To show, by cross-examination
on the commonest words that what every one appears to know, and talks about most confidently, no one really knows or can distinctly explain.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_26" href="#Footnotev2_20_26"><span
class="sp">26</span></a> This is the meaning of the final declaration <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page185" id="v2page185"></a>185</span>put into the mouth of Sokrates. &ldquo;We believe
ourselves to be each other&rsquo;s friends, yet we none of us know what a friend is.&rdquo; The question is one, which no one had ever troubled himself to investigate, or thought it requisite to ask
from others. Every one supposed himself to know, and every one had in his memory an aggregate of conceptions and beliefs which he accounted tantamount to knowledge: an aggregate generated by the
unconscious addition of a thousand facts and associations, each separately unimportant and often inconsistent with the remainder: while no rational analysis had ever been applied to verify the
consistency of this spontaneous product, or to define the familiar words in which it is expressed. The reader is here involved in a cloud of confusion respecting Friendship. No way out of it is
shown, and how is he to find one? He must take the matter into his own active and studious meditation: which he has never yet done, though the word is always in his mouth, and though the topic is
among the most common and familiar, upon which &ldquo;the swain treads daily with his clouted shoon&ldquo;.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_20_26" id="Footnotev2_20_26"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_20_26">26</a></span> Among the many points of analogy between the Lysis and the
Charmid&ecirc;s, one is, That both of them are declared to be spurious and unworthy of Plato, by Socher as well as by Ast (Ast, Platon&rsquo;s Leben, pp. 429-434; Socher, Ueber Platon, pp.
137-144).</p>

<p>Schleiermacher ranks the Lysis as second in his Platonic series of dialogues, an appendix to the Ph&aelig;drus (Einl. p. 174 seq.); K. F. Hermann, Stallbaum, and nearly all the other critics
dissent from this view: they place the Lysis as an early dialogue, along with Charmid&ecirc;s and Lach&ecirc;s, anterior to the Protagoras (K. F. Hermann, Gesch. und Syst. Plat. Phil. pp. 447-448;
Stallbaum, Proleg. ad Lys. p. 90 (110 2nd ed.); Steinhart, Einl. p. 221) near to or during the government of the Thirty. All of them profess to discover in the Lysis &ldquo;adolescenti&aelig;
vestigia&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Ast and Socher characterise the dialogue as a tissue of subtle sophistry and eristic contradiction, such as (in their opinion) Plato cannot have composed. Stallbaum concedes the sophistry, but
contends that it is put by Plato intentionally, for the purpose of deriding, exposing, disgracing, the Sophists and their dialectical tricks: &ldquo;ludibrii caus&acirc;&rdquo; (p. 88); &ldquo;ut
illustri aliquo exemplo demonstretur dialecticam istam, quam adolescentes magno quodam studio sectabantur, nihil esse aliud, nisi inanem quandam argutiarum captatricem,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 87).
Nevertheless he contends that along with this derisory matter there is intermingled serious reasoning which may be easily distinguished (p. 87), but which certainly he does not clearly point out.
(Compare pp. 108-9-14-15, 2nd ed.) Schleiermacher and Steinhart also (pp. 222-224-227) admit the sophistry in which Sokrates is here made to indulge. But Steinhart maintains that there is an
assignable philosophical purpose in the dialogue, which Plato purposely wrapped up in enigmatical language, but of which he (Steinhart) professes to give the solution (p. 228).</p>

reasons why each is defective.</span></p>

<p>This was a proper subject for a dialogue of Search. In the dialogue Lysis, Plato describes Sokrates as engaged in one of these searches, handling, testing, and dropping, one point of view after
another, respecting the idea and foundation of friendship. He speaks, professedly, as a diviner or guesser; following out obscure promptings which he does not yet understand himself.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_20_27" href="#Footnotev2_20_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> In this character, he suggests several different explanations, not only distinct but inconsistent with each other; each of
them true to a certain extent, under certain conditions and circumstances: but each of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page186" id="v2page186"></a>186</span>them untrue, when we travel beyond those
limits: other contradictory considerations then interfering. To multiply defective explanations, and to indicate why each is defective, is the whole business of the dialogue.</p>

dialogue for self-working minds.</span></p>

<p>Schleiermacher discovers in this dialogue indications of a positive result not plainly enunciated: but he admits that Aristotle did not discover them &mdash; nor can I believe them to have been
intended by the author.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_28" href="#Footnotev2_20_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> But most critics speak slightingly of it, as alike sceptical and sophistical: and some even
deny its authenticity on these grounds. Plato might have replied by saying that he intended it as a specimen illustrating the process of search for an unknown <i>qu&aelig;situm</i>; and as an
exposition of what can be said for, as well as against, many different points of view. The process of trial and error, the most general fact of human intelligence, is even better illustrated when the
search is unsuccessful: because when a result is once obtained, most persons care for nothing else and forget the antecedent blunders. To those indeed, who ask only to hear the result as soon as it
is found, and who wait for others to look for it &mdash; such a dialogue as the Lysis will appear of little value. But to any one who intends to search for it himself, or to study the same problem
for himself, the report thus presented of a previous unsuccessful search, is useful both as guidance and warning. Every one of the tentative solutions indicated in the Lysis has something in its
favour, yet is nevertheless inadmissible. To learn the grounds which ultimately compel us to reject what at first appears admissible, is instruction not to be despised; at the very least, it helps to

<p>In truth, no one general solution is attainable, such as Plato here professes to search for.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_29" href="#Footnotev2_20_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> In one of the three
Xenophontic dialogues wherein the subject of friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page187" id="v2page187"></a>187</span> is discussed we find the real Sokrates presenting it with a juster view
of its real complications.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_30" href="#Footnotev2_20_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> The same remark may be made upon Aristotle&rsquo;s manner of handling friendship in the
Ethics. He seems plainly to allude to the Lysis (though not mentioning it by name); and to profit by it at least in what he puts out of consideration, if not in what he brings forward.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_20_31" href="#Footnotev2_20_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> He discards the physical and cosmical analogies, which Plato borrows from Empedokles and Herakleitus, as too remote and
inapplicable: he considers that the question must be determined by facts and principles relating to human dispositions and conduct. In other ways, he circumscribes the problem, by setting aside (what
Plato includes) all objects of attachment which are not capable of reciprocating attachment.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_32" href="#Footnotev2_20_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> The problem, as set
forth here by Plato, is conceived in great generality. In what manner does one man become the friend of another?<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_33" href="#Footnotev2_20_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> How
does a man become the object <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page188" id="v2page188"></a>188</span>of friendship or love from another? What is that object towards which our love or friendship is

<p>&ldquo;Qu&rsquo;on se r&eacute;presente la foule des acceptions du mot <i>esprit</i>, depuis son sens primitif <i>spiritus, haleine</i>, jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; ceux qu&rsquo;on lui donne dans la
chimie, dans la litt&eacute;rature, dans la jurisprudence, <i>esprit acide</i>, esprit de Montaigne, <i>esprit des loix</i>, &amp;c. &mdash; qu&rsquo;on essaie d&rsquo;extraire de toutes ces
acceptions une id&eacute;e qui soit commune &agrave; toutes &mdash; on verra s&rsquo;&eacute;vanouir tous les caract&egrave;res qui distinguent <i>l&rsquo;esprit</i> de toute autre chose, dans
quelque sens qu&rsquo;on le prenne.... La multitude et l&rsquo;incompatibilit&eacute; des acceptions du mot <i>esprit</i>, sont telles, que personne n&rsquo;a &eacute;t&eacute; tent&eacute; de les

lorsqu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;est pas assez sensible pour emp&ecirc;cher qu&rsquo;on ne la suive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mesure que le nombre et la diversit&eacute; des acceptions diminue, l&rsquo;absurdit&eacute; s&rsquo;affoiblit: et quand elle disparoit, il reste encore l&rsquo;erreur. J&rsquo;ose dire,
que presque toutes les <i>d&eacute;finitions</i> o&ugrave; l&rsquo;on annonce qu&rsquo;on va d&eacute;finir les choses <i>dans le sens le plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</i>, ont ce
d&eacute;faut, et ne d&eacute;finissent v&eacute;ritablement rien: parceque leurs auteurs, en voulant renfermer toutes les acceptions d&rsquo;un mot, ont entrepris une chose impossible: je veux dire,
de rassembler sous une seule id&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des id&eacute;es tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rentes entre elles, et qu&rsquo;un m&ecirc;me nom n&rsquo;a jamais pu d&eacute;signer que

<p>This observation of Sokrates is very true and valuable &mdash; that the causes of friendship and the causes of enmity are both of them equally natural, <i>i.e.</i> equally interwoven with the
constant conditions of individual and social life. This is very different from the vague, partial, and encomiastic predicates with which &tau;&#8056; &phi;&#973;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; is often
decorated elsewhere by Sokrates himself, as well as by Plato and Aristotle.</p>

&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#8056;&nu; &epsilon;&#7990;&nu;&alpha;&iota;. This allusion to the soft and the smooth is not very clear; a passage in Mr. Bain&rsquo;s chapter serves to illustrate it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the sensations of the senses we find some that have the power of awakening tender emotion. The sensations that incline to tenderness are, in the first place, the effects of very
gentle or soft stimulants, such as soft touches, gentle sounds, slow movements, temperate warmth, mild sunshine. These sensations must be felt in order to produce the effect, which is mental and not
simply organic. We have seen that an acute sensation raises a vigorous muscular expression, as in wonder; a contrast to this is exhibited by gentle pressure or mild radiance. Hence tenderness is
passive emotion by pre-eminence: we see it flourishing best in the quiescence of the moving members. Remotely there may be a large amount of action stimulated by it, but the proper outgoing
accompaniment of it is organic not muscular.&ldquo;</p>

<p>That the sensations of the soft and the smooth dispose to the Tender Emotion is here pointed out as a fact in human nature, agreeably to the comparison of Plato. Mr. Bain&rsquo;s treatise has the
rare merit of describing fully the physical as well as the mental characteristics of each separate emotion.</p>

real Sokrates would have found reason for challenging.</span></p>

<p>The debate in the Lysis is partly verbal: <i>i.e.</i>, respecting the word &phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;, whether it means the person loving, or the person loved, or whether it shall be
confined to those cases in which the love is reciprocal, and then applied to both. Herein the question is about the meaning of words &mdash; a word and nothing more. The following portions of the
dialogue enter upon questions not verbal but real &mdash; &ldquo;Whether we are disposed to love what is like to ourselves, or what is unlike or opposite to ourselves?&rdquo; Though both these are
occasionally true, it is shown that as general explanations neither of them will hold. But this is shown by means of the following assumptions, which not only those whom Plato here calls the
&ldquo;very clever Disputants,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_35" href="#Footnotev2_20_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> but Sokrates himself at other times, would have called in question, viz.:
&ldquo;That bad men cannot be friends to each other &mdash; that men like to each <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page189" id="v2page189"></a>189</span>other (therefore good men as well as bad) can
be of no use to each other, and therefore there can be no basis of friendship between them &mdash; that the good man is self-sufficing, stands in need of no one, and therefore will not love any
one.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_36" href="#Footnotev2_20_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> All these assumptions Sokrates would have found sufficient reason for challenging, if they had been
advanced by Protagoras or any other opponents. They stand here as affirmed by him; but here, as elsewhere in Plato, the reader must apply his own critical intellect, and test what he reads for
himself.</p>

composed in a style of pleasing rhetoric; suitable to L&aelig;lius, an ancient Roman senator and active politician, who expressly renounces the accurate subtlety of Grecian philosophers (v. 18).
There is little in it which we can compare with the Platonic Lysis; but I observe that he too, giving expression to his own feelings, maintains that there can be no friendship except between the good
and virtuous: a position which is refuted by the &ldquo;nefaria vox,&rdquo; cited by himself as spoken by C. Blossius, xi. 37.</p>

superficial tinge of evil, and desiring good to escape from it.</span></p>

<p>It is thus shown, or supposed to be shown, that the persons who love are neither the Good, nor the Bad: and that the objects loved, are neither things or persons similar, nor opposite, to the
persons loving. Sokrates now adverts to the existence of a third category &mdash; Persons who are neither good, nor bad, but intermediate between the two &mdash; Objects which are intermediate
between likeness and opposition. He announces as his own conjecture,<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_37" href="#Footnotev2_20_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> that the Subject of friendly or loving feeling,
is, that which is neither good nor evil: the Object of the feeling, Good: and the cause of the feeling, the superficial presence of evil, which the subject desires to see removed.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_20_38" href="#Footnotev2_20_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> The evil must be present in a superficial and removable manner &mdash; like whiteness in the hair caused by white paint, not
by the grey colour of old age. Sokrates applies this to the state of mind of the philosopher, or lover of knowledge: who is not yet either thoroughly good or thoroughly bad, &mdash; either thoroughly
wise or thoroughly unwise &mdash; but in a state intermediate between the two: ignorant, yet conscious of his own ignorance, and feeling it as a misfortune which he was anxious to shake off.<a name=

the philosopher or lover of wisdom. Painful consciousness of ignorance the attribute of the philosopher. Value set by Sokrates and Plato upon this attribute.</span></p>

<p>This meaning of philosophy, though it is not always and consistently maintained throughout the Platonic writings, is important as expanding and bringing into system the position laid down by
Sokrates in the Apology. He there disclaimed all pretensions to wisdom, but he announced himself as a philosopher, in the above literal sense: that is, as ignorant, yet as painfully conscious of his
own ignorance, and anxiously searching for wisdom as a corrective to it: while most men were equally ignorant, but were unconscious of their own ignorance, believed themselves to be already wise, and
delivered confident opinions without ever having analysed the matters on which they spoke. The conversation of Sokrates (as I have before remarked) was intended, not to teach wisdom, but to raise men
out of this false persuasion of wisdom, which he believed to be the natural state of the human mind, into that mental condition which he called philosophy. His Elenchus made them conscious of their
ignorance, anxious to escape from it, and prepared for mental efforts in search of knowledge: in which search Sokrates assisted them, but without declaring, and even professing inability to declare,
where that truth lay in which the search was to end. He considered that this change was in itself a great and serious improvement, converting what was evil, radical, and engrained &mdash; into evil
superficial and removable; which was a preliminary condition to any positive acquirement. The first thing to be done was to create searchers after truth, men who would look at the subject for
themselves with earnest attention, and make up their own individual convictions. Even if nothing ulterior were achieved, that alone would be a great deal. Such was the scope of the Sokratic
conversation; and such the conception of philosophy (the capital peculiarity which Plato borrowed from Sokrates), which is briefly noted in this passage of the Lysis, and developed in other Platonic
dialogues, especially in the Symposion,<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_40" href="#Footnotev2_20_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> which we shall reach presently.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_20_25" id="Sidenotev2_20_25"></a> Another theory of Sokrates. The Primum Amabile, or original and primary object of Love. Particular objects are loved
through association with this. The object is, Good.</span></p>

<p>Still, however, Sokrates is not fully satisfied with this hypothesis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page191" id="v2page191"></a>191</span> but passes on to another. If we love anything, we must
love it (he says) for the sake of something. This implies that there must exist, in the background, a something which is the primitive and real object of affection. The various things which we
actually love, are not loved for their own sake, but for the sake of this <i>primum amabile</i>, and as shadows projected by it: just as a man who loves his son, comes to love by association what is
salutary or comforting to his son &mdash; or as he loves money for the sake of what money will purchase. The <i>primum amabile</i>, in the view of Sokrates, is <i>Good</i>; particular things loved,
are loved as shadows of good.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_20_26" id="Sidenotev2_20_26"></a> Statement by Plato of the general law of mental association.</span></p>

<p>This is a doctrine which we shall find reproduced in other dialogues. We note with interest here, that it appears illustrated, by a statement of the general law of mental association &mdash; the
calling up of one idea by other ideas or by sensations, and the transference of affections from one object to others which have been apprehended in conjunction with it, either as antecedents or
consequents. Plato states this law clearly in the Ph&aelig;don and elsewhere:<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_41" href="#Footnotev2_20_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> but he here conceives it imperfectly:
for he seems to believe that, if an affection be transferred by association from a primitive object A, to other objects, B, C, D, &amp;c., A always continues to be the only real object of affection,
while B, C, D, &amp;c., operate upon the mind merely by carrying it back to A. The affection towards B, C, D, &amp;c., therefore is, in the view of Plato, only the affection for A under other
denominations and disguises.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_42" href="#Footnotev2_20_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> Now this is doubtless often the case; but often also, perhaps even more generally, it is
not the case. After a certain length of repetition and habit, all conscious reference to the primitive object of affection will commonly be left out, and the affection towards the secondary object
will become a feeling both substantive and immediate. What was originally loved as means, for the sake of an ulterior end, will in time come to be loved as <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page192"
id="v2page192"></a>192</span>an end for itself; and to constitute a new centre of force, from whence derivatives may branch out. It may even come to be loved more vehemently than any primitive object
of affection, if it chance to accumulate in itself derivative influences from many of those objects.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_43" href="#Footnotev2_20_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> This remark
naturally presents itself, when we meet here for the first time, distinctly stated by Plato, the important psychological doctrine of the transference of affections by association from one object to
others.</p>

<p>The important point to which I here call attention, in respect to the law of Mental Association, is forcibly illustrated by Mr. James Mill in his &lsquo;Analysis of the Human Mind,&rsquo; chapters
xxi. and xxii., and by Professor Bain in his works on the Senses and the Intellect, &mdash; Intellect, chap. i. sect. 47-48, p. 404 seq. ed. 3; and on the Emotions and the Will, chap. iv. sect. 4-5,

Generic communion of Aristotle, distinguished by him from the feebler analogical communion.</span></p>

<p>The <i>primum amabile</i>, here introduced by Sokrates, is described in restricted terms, as valuable merely to correct evil, and as having no value <i>per se</i>, if evil were assumed not to
exist. In consequence chiefly of this restriction, Sokrates discards it as unsatisfactory. Such restriction, however, is noway essential to the doctrine: which approaches to, but is not coincident
with, the Ideal Good or Idea of Good, described in other dialogues as what every one yearns after and aspires to, though without ever attaining it and without even knowing what it is.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_20_44" href="#Footnotev2_20_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> The Platonic Idea was conceived as a substantive, intelligible, Ens, distinct in its nature from all the particulars bearing
the same name, and separated from them all by a gulf which admitted no gradations of nearer and farther &mdash; yet communicating itself to, or partaken by, all of them, in some inexplicable way.
Aristotle combated this doctrine, denying the separate reality of the Idea, and admitting only a common generic essence, dwelling in and pervading the particulars, but pervading them all equally. The
general word connoting this generic unity was said by Aristotle (retaining the Platonic phraseology) to be &lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu; &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048;
&mu;&#943;&alpha;&nu; &#7984;&delta;&#941;&alpha;&nu; or &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&rsquo; &#7957;&nu;.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_20_44" id="Footnotev2_20_44"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_20_44">44</a></span> Plato, Republ. vi. pp. 505-506.</p>
</div>

<p>But apart from and beyond such generic unity, which implied a common essence belonging to all, Aristotle recognised a looser, more imperfect, yet more extensive, communion, founded upon <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page193" id="v2page193"></a>193</span>common relationship towards some &#7944;&rho;&chi;&#8052; &mdash; First Principle or First Object. Such relationship was not always
the same in kind: it might be either resemblance, concomitance, antecedence or consequence, &amp;c.: it might also be different in degree, closer or more remote, direct or indirect. Here, then, there
was room for graduation, or ordination of objects as former and latter, first, second, third, &amp;c., according as, when compared with each other, they were more or less related to the common root.
This imperfect communion was designated by Aristotle under the title &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&rsquo; &#7936;&nu;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#943;&alpha;&nu;, as contrasted with
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048; &gamma;&#941;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;: the predicate which affirmed it was said to be applied, not &kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048; &mu;&#943;&alpha;&nu;
&#7984;&delta;&#941;&alpha;&nu; or &kappa;&alpha;&theta;&rsquo; &#7957;&nu;, but &pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf; &mu;&#943;&alpha;&nu; &phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&nu; or &pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf; &#7957;&nu;:<a
name="FnAnchorv2_20_45" href="#Footnotev2_20_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> it was affirmed neither entirely &sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&omega;&nu;&#973;&mu;&omega;&sigmaf; (which would imply generic
communion), nor entirely &#8001;&mu;&omega;&nu;&#973;&mu;&omega;&sigmaf; (which would be casual and imply no communion at all), but midway between the two, so as to admit of a graduated communion,
and an arrangement as former and later, first cousin, or second, third cousin. Members <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page194" id="v2page194"></a>194</span>of the same Genus were considered to be
brothers, all on a par: but wherever there was this graduated cousinship or communion (signified by the words Former and Later, more or less in degree of relationship), Aristotle did not admit a
common Genus, nor did Plato admit a Substantive Idea.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_46" href="#Footnotev2_20_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a></p>

given, though not circumscribed; it is determined, not by a boundary but by a central point within, &amp;c.&rdquo; The coincidence between this doctrine and the Aristotelian is real, though only
partial: &tau;&#8056; &pi;&rho;&#8182;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;, &tau;&#8056; &pi;&rho;&#8182;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &#8001;&rho;&epsilon;&kappa;&tau;&#972;&nu;, may be
considered as types of <i>objects loveable, objects desirable</i>, &amp;c., but &#7969; &#8017;&gamma;&iota;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha; cannot be considered as a type of &tau;&#8048;
&#8017;&gamma;&iota;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&#8048; nor &#7969; &#7984;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8052; as a type of &tau;&#8048; &#7984;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#940;, though it is &ldquo;the
central point&ldquo; to which all things so called are referred. See Dr. Whewell&rsquo;s doctrine stated in the Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, i. 476-477; and the comments of Mr. John Stuart
Mill on the doctrine &mdash; &lsquo;System of Logic,&rsquo; Book iv. ch. 7. I have adverted to this same doctrine in remarking on the Hippias Major, <a href="#Sidenotev2_13_22">supra, p. 47</a>; also

<p>Now the &Pi;&rho;&#8182;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &phi;&#943;&lambda;&omicron;&nu; or Primum Amabile which we find in the Lysis, is described as the principium or initial root of one of these imperfectly
united aggregates; ramifying into many branches more or less distant, in obedience to one or other of the different laws of association. Aristotle expresses the same idea in another form of words:
instead of a Primum Amabile, he gives us a Prima Amicitia &mdash; affirming that the diversities of friendship are not species comprehended under the same genus, but gradations or degeneracies
departing in one direction or other from the First or pure Friendship. The Primum Amabile, in Plato&rsquo;s view, appears to be the Good, though he does not explicitly declare it: the Prima Amicitia,
with Aristotle, is friendship subsisting between two good persons, who have had sufficient experience to know, esteem, and trust, each other.<a name="FnAnchorv2_20_47" href="#Footnotev2_20_47"><span

<p>Dramatic vivacity, and comic force, holding up various persons to ridicule or contempt, are attributes which Plato manifests often and abundantly. But the dialogue in which these qualities reach
their maximum, is, the Euthyd&ecirc;mus. Some portions of it approach to the Nubes of Aristophanes: so that Schleiermacher, Stallbaum, and other admiring critics have some difficulty in explaining,

"#Footnotev2_21_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> upon reasons, which, even if admitted, might prove that the dialogue was an inferior performance, but would not prove that Plato was not the
author.</p>

<p>Sokrates recounts (to Kriton) a conversation in which he has just been engaged with two Sophists, Euthyd&ecirc;mus and Dionysodorus, in the undressing-room belonging to the gymnasium of the
Lykeium. There were present, besides, Kleinias, a youth of remarkable beauty and intelligence, cousin of the great Alkibiades &mdash; Ktesippus, an adult man, yet still young, friend of Sokrates and
devotedly attached to Kleinias &mdash; <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page196" id="v2page196"></a>196</span>and a crowd of unnamed persons, partly friends of Kleinias, partly admirers and
supporters of the two Sophists.</p>

<p>This couple are described and treated throughout by Sokrates, with the utmost admiration and respect: that is, in terms designating such feelings, but intended as the extreme of irony or
caricature. They are masters of the art of Contention, in its three varieties<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_3" href="#Footnotev2_21_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> &mdash; 1. Arms, and the command of
soldiers. 2. Judicial and political rhetoric, fighting an opponent before the assembled Dikasts or people. 3. Contentious Dialectic &mdash; they can reduce every respondent to a contradiction, if he
will only continue to answer their questions &mdash; whether what he says be true or false.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_4" href="#Footnotev2_21_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> All or each of these
accomplishments they are prepared to teach to any pupil who will pay the required fee: the standing sarcasm of Plato against the paid teacher, occurring here as in so many other places. Lastly, they
are brothers, old and almost toothless &mdash; natives of Chios, colonists from thence to Thurii, and exiles from Thurii and resident at Athens, yet visiting other cities for the purpose of giving
lessons.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_5" href="#Footnotev2_21_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> Their dialectic skill is described as a recent acquisition, &mdash; made during their old age, only in the
preceding year, &mdash; and completing their excellence as professors of the tripartite Eristic. But they now devote themselves to it more than to the other two parts. Moreover they advertise
themselves as teachers of virtue.</p>

<p>Steinhart, in his Einleitung zum Euthydemos (vol. ii. p. 2 of Hieronym. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s translation of Plato) repeats these antecedents of Euthydemus and Dionysodorus, as recited in the
dialogue before us, as if they were matter of real history, exemplifications of the character of the class called Sophists. He might just as well produce what is said by the comic poets Eupolis and
Aristophanes &mdash; the proceedings as recounted by the Sokratic disciple in the &phi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&nu; (Nubes) &mdash; as evidence about the

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_4" id="Sidenotev2_21_4"></a> Conversation carried on with Kleinias, first by Sokrates, next by the two Sophists.</span></p>

<p>The two Sophists, having announced themselves as competent to teach virtue and stimulate pupils to a virtuous life, are entreated by Sokrates to exercise their beneficent influence upon the youth
Kleinias, in whose improvement he as well as Ktesippus feels the warmest interest. Sokrates gives a specimen of what he wishes by putting a series of questions himself. Euthyd&ecirc;mus follows, and
begins questioning Kleinias; who, after answering <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page197" id="v2page197"></a>197</span>three or four successive questions, is forced to contradict himself.
Dionysodorus then takes up the last answer of Kleinias, puts him through another series of interrogations, and makes him contradict himself again. In this manner the two Sophists toss the youthful
respondent backwards and forwards to each other, each contriving to entangle him in some puzzle and contradiction. They even apply the same process to Sokrates, who cannot avoid being entangled in
the net; and to Ktesippus, who becomes exasperated, and retorts upon them with contemptuous asperity. The alternate interference of the two Sophists is described with great smartness and animation;
which is promoted by the use of the dual number, peculiar to the Greek language, employed by Plato in speaking of them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_5" id="Sidenotev2_21_5"></a> Contrast between the two different modes of interrogation.</span></p>

<p>This mode of dialectic, conducted by the two Sophists, is interrupted on two several occasions by a counter-exhibition of dialectic on the part of Sokrates: who, under colour of again showing to
the couple a specimen of that which he wishes them to do, puts two successive batches of questions to Kleinias in his own manner.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_6" href="#Footnotev2_21_6"><span class=
"sp">6</span></a> The contrast between Sokrates and the two Sophists, in the same work, carried on respectively by him and by them, of interrogating Kleinias, is evidently meant as one of the special
matters to arrest attention in the dialogue. The questions put by the couple are made to turn chiefly on verbal quibbles and ambiguities: they are purposely designed to make the respondent contradict
himself, and are proclaimed to be certain of bringing about this result, provided the respondent will conform to the laws of dialectic &mdash; by confining his answer to the special point of the
question, without adding any qualification of his own, or asking for farther explanation from the questioner, or reverting to any antecedent answer lying apart from the actual question of the
moment.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_7" href="#Footnotev2_21_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> Sokrates, on the contrary, addresses interrogations, each of which has a clear and substantive meaning, and most
of which Kleinias is able to answer without embarrassment: he professes no other design except that of encouraging Kleinias to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page198" id="v2page198">
</a>198</span>virtue, and assisting him to determine in what virtue consists: he resorts to no known quibbles or words of equivocal import. The effect of the interrogations is represented as being,
not to confound and silence the youth, but to quicken and stimulate his mind and to call forth an unexpected amount of latent knowledge: insomuch that he makes one or two answers very much beyond his
years, exciting the greatest astonishment and admiration, in Sokrates as well as in Kriton.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_8" href="#Footnotev2_21_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> In this respect, the youth
Kleinias serves the same illustrative purpose as the youthful slave in the Menon:<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_9" href="#Footnotev2_21_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> each is supposed to be quickened by
the interrogatory of Sokrates, into a manifestation of knowledge noway expected, nor traceable to any teaching. But in the Menon, this magical evocation of knowledge from an untaught youth is
explained by the theory of reminiscence, pre-existence, and omniscience, of the soul: while in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, no allusion is made to any such theory, nor to any other cause except the stimulus
of the Sokratic cross-questioning.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_6" id="Sidenotev2_21_6"></a> Wherein this contrast does not consist.</span></p>

<p>In the dialogue <i>Euthyd&ecirc;mus</i>, then, one main purpose of Plato is to exhibit in contrast two distinct modes of questioning: one practised by Euthydemus and Dionysodorus; the other, by
Sokrates. Of these two, it is the first which is shown up in the most copious and elaborate manner: the second is made subordinate, serving mainly as a standard of comparison with the first. We must
take care however to understand in what the contrast between the two consists, and in what it does not consist.</p>

<p>The contrast does not consist in this &mdash; that Sokrates so contrives his string of questions as to bring out some established and positive conclusion, while Euthydemus and his brother leave
everything in perplexity. Such is not the fact. Sokrates ends without any result, and with a confession of his inability to find any. Professing earnest anxiety to stimulate Kleinias in the path of
virtue, he is at the same time unable to define what the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page199" id="v2page199"></a>199</span>capital condition of virtue is.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_10" href=
"#Footnotev2_21_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> On this point, then, there is no contrast between Sokrates and his competitors: if they land their pupil in embarrassment, so does he. Nor, again,
does Sokrates stand distinguished from them by affirming (or rather implying in his questions) nothing but what is true and indisputable.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_11" href="#Footnotev2_21_11"><span

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_7" id="Sidenotev2_21_7"></a> Wherein it does consist.</span></p>

<p>The real contrast between the competitors, consists, first in the pretensions &mdash; next in the method. The two Sophists are described as persons of exorbitant arrogance, professing to teach
virtue,<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_12" href="#Footnotev2_21_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> and claiming a fee as if they did teach it: Sokrates disdains the fee, doubts whether such teaching is
possible, and professes only to encourage or help forward on the road a willing pupil. The pupil in this case is a given subject, Kleinias, a modest and intelligent youth: and the whole scene passes
in public before an indiscriminate audience. To such a pupil, what is needed is, encouragement and guidance. Both of these are really administered by the questions of Sokrates, which are all
suggestive and pertinent to the matter in hand, though failing to reach a satisfactory result: moreover, Sokrates attends only to Kleinias, and is indifferent to the effect on the audience around.
The two Sophists, on the contrary, do not say a word pertinent to the object desired. Far from seeking (as they promised) to encourage Kleinias,<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_13" href=
"#Footnotev2_21_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> they confuse and humiliate him from the beginning: all their implements for teaching consist only of logical puzzles; lastly, their main purpose is
to elicit applause from the by-standers, by reducing both the modest Kleinias and every other respondent to contradiction and stand-still.</p>

<p>Such is the real contrast between Sokrates and the two Sophists, and such is the real scene which we read in the dialogue. The presence, as well as the loud manifestations of an indiscriminate

humiliation of a youth who requires opposite treatment, in the prosecution of an object which they do not really promote and before undiscerning auditors, for whose applause the two Sophists are
bidding.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_15" href="#Footnotev2_21_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> The whole debate upon these fallacies is rendered ridiculous; and when conducted with Ktesippus, degenerates

<p>The bearing of the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, as I here state it, will be better understood if we contrast it with the Parmenid&ecirc;s. In this last-mentioned dialogue, the amount of negative dialectic
and contradiction is greater and more serious than that which we read in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus. One single case of it is elaborately built up in the long Antinomies at the close of the
Parmenid&ecirc;s (which occupy as much space, and contain nearly as much sophistry, as the speeches assigned to the two Sophists in Euthyd&ecirc;mus), while we are given to understand that many more
remain behind.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_16" href="#Footnotev2_21_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> These perplexing Antinomies (addressed by the veteran Parmenides to Sokrates as his junior), after a
variety of other objections against the Platonic theory of Ideas, which theory Sokrates has been introduced as affirming, &mdash; are drawn up for the avowed purpose of checking premature
affirmation, and of illustrating the difficult exercises and problems which must be solved, before affirmation can become justifiable. This task, though long and laborious, cannot be evaded (we are
here told) by aspirants in philosophy. But it is a task which ought only to be undertaken in conjunction with a few select companions. &ldquo;Before any large audience, it would be unseemly and
inadmissible: for the public are not aware that without such roundabout and devious journey in all directions, no man can hit upon truth or acquire intelligence.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_17"

negative, before we venture upon the affirmative, is common to both: in the one the process is solitary and serious; in the other, it is vulgarised and ludicrous.</span></p>

<p>This important proposition &mdash; That before a man can be entitled to lay down with confidence any affirmative theory, in the domain of philosophy or &ldquo;reasoned truth,&rdquo; he must have
had before him the various knots tied by negative dialectic, and must find out the way of untying them &mdash; is a postulate which lies at the bottom of Plato&rsquo;s Dialogues of Search, as I have
remarked in the eighth chapter of this work. But there is much difference in the time, manner, and circumstances, under which such knots are brought before the student for solution. In the
Parmenid&ecirc;s the process is presented as one both serious and indispensable, yet requiring some precautions: the public must be excluded, for they do not understand the purpose: and the student
under examination must be one who is competent or more than competent to bear the heavy burthen put upon him, as Sokrates is represented to be in the Parmenid&ecirc;s.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_18" href=
"#Footnotev2_21_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> In the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, on the contrary, the process is intended to be made ridiculous; accordingly these precautions are disregarded. The crowd of
indiscriminate auditors are not only present, but are the persons whose feelings the two Sophists address &mdash; and who either admire what is said as dexterous legerdemain, or laugh at the
interchange of thrusts, as the duel becomes warmer: in fact, the debate ends with general mirth, in which the couple themselves are among the loudest.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_19" href=
"#Footnotev2_21_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> Lastly, Kleinias, the youth under interrogation, is a modest novice; not represented, like Lysis in the dialogue just reviewed, as in danger of
corruption from the exorbitant flatteries of an Erastes, nor as requiring a lowering medicine to be administered by a judicious friend. When the Xenophontic (historical) Sokrates cross-examines and
humiliates Euthyd&ecirc;mus (a youth, but nevertheless more advanced than Kleinias in the Platonic Euthyd&ecirc;mus is represented to be), we shall see that he not only lays a train for the process
by antecedent suggestions, but takes especial care to attack Euthyd&ecirc;mus when alone.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_20" href="#Footnotev2_21_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> The cross-examination <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page202" id="v2page202"></a>202</span>pursued by Sokrates inflicts upon this accomplished young man the severest distress and humiliation, and would have been utterly
intolerable, if there had been by-standers clapping their hands (as we read in the Platonic Euthyd&ecirc;mus) whenever the respondent was driven into a corner. We see that it was hardly tolerable
even when the respondent was alone with Sokrates; for though Euthyd&ecirc;mus bore up against the temporary suffering, cultivated the society of Sokrates, and was handled by him more gently
afterwards; yet there were many other youths whom Sokrates cross-examined in the same way, and who suffered so much humiliation from the first solitary colloquy, that they never again came near him
(so Xenophon expressly tells us)<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_21" href="#Footnotev2_21_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> for a second. This is quite enough to show us how important is the injunction
delivered in the Platonic Parmenid&ecirc;s &mdash; to carry on these testing colloquies apart from indiscriminate auditors, in the presence, at most, of a few select companions.</p>

way in which Protagoras and Gorgias talked to their auditors.</span></p>

<p>Stallbaum, Steinhart, and other commentators denounce in severe terms the Eristics or controversial Sophists of Athens, as disciples of Protagoras and Gorgias, infected with the mania of
questioning and disputing every thing, and thereby corrupting the minds of youth. They tell us that Sokrates was the constant enemy of this school, but that nevertheless he was unjustly confounded
with them by the comic poets, and others; from which confusion alone his unpopularity with the Athenian people arose.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_22" href="#Footnotev2_21_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
In the Platonic dialogue of Euthyd&ecirc;mus the two Sophists (according to these commentators) represent the way in which Protagoras and Gorgias with their disciples reasoned: and the purpose of the
dialogue is to contrast this with the way in which Sokrates reasoned.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_12" id="Sidenotev2_21_12"></a> That opinion is unfounded. Sokrates was much more Eristic than Protagoras, who generally manifested himself by
continuous speech or lecture.</span></p>

<p>Now, in this opinion, I think that there is much of unfounded assumption, as well as a misconception of the real contrast intended in the Platonic Euthyd&ecirc;mus. Comparing<span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page203" id="v2page203"></a>203</span> Protagoras with Sokrates, I maintain that Sokrates was decidedly the more Eristic of the two, and left behind him a greater number of
active disciples. In so far as we can trust the picture given by Plato in the dialogue called Protagoras, we learn that the Sophist of that name chiefly manifested himself in long continuous speeches
or rhetoric; and though he also professed, if required, to enter into dialectic colloquy, in this art he was no match for Sokrates.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_23" href="#Footnotev2_21_23"><span class=
"sp">23</span></a> Moreover, we know by the evidence of Sokrates himself, that <i>he</i> was an Eristic not only by taste, but on principle, and by a sense of duty. He tells us, in the Platonic
Apology, that he felt himself under a divine mission to go about convicting men of ignorance, and that he had prosecuted this vocation throughout many years of a long life. Every one of these
convictions must have been brought about by one or more disputes of his own seeking: every such dispute, with occasional exceptions, made him unpopular, in the outset at least, with the person
convicted: the rather, as his ability in the process is known, upon the testimony of Xenophon<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_24" href="#Footnotev2_21_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> as well as of Plato, to
have been consummate. It is therefore a mistake to decry Protagoras and the Protagoreans (if there were any) as the special Eristics, and to represent Sokrates as a tutelary genius, the opponent of
such habits. If the commentators are right (which I do not think they are) in declaring the Athenian mind to have been perverted by Eristic, Sokrates is much more chargeable with the mischief than
Protagoras. And the comic poets, when they treated Sokrates as a specimen and teacher of Eristic, proceeded very naturally upon what they actually saw or heard of him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_25" href=

<p>The fact is, that the Platonic Sokrates when he talks with the two Sophists in the dialogue Euthyd&ecirc;mus, is a character drawn by Plato for the purpose of that dialogue, and is very different
from the real historical Sokrates, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page204" id="v2page204"></a>204</span>whom the public of Athens saw and heard in the market-place or gymnasia. He is depicted as a
gentle, soothing, encouraging talker, with his claws drawn in, and affecting inability even to hold his own against the two Sophists: such indeed as he sometimes may have been in conversing with
particular persons (so Xenophon<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_26" href="#Footnotev2_21_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> takes pains to remind his readers in the Memorabilia), but with entire elimination of
that characteristic aggressive Elenchus for which he himself (in the Platonic Apology) takes credit, and which the auditors usually heard him exhibit.</p>

persons.</span></p>

<p>This picture, accurate or not, suited the dramatic scheme of the Euthyd&ecirc;mus. Such, in my judgment, is the value and meaning of the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, as far as regards personal contrasts. One
style of reasoning is represented by Sokrates, the other by the two Sophists: both are the creatures of Plato, having the same dramatic reality as Sokrates and Strepsiades, or the
&Delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; &Lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf; and &#7948;&delta;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf; &Lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;, of Aristophanes, but
no more. That they correspond to any actual persons at Athens, is neither proved nor probable. The comic poets introduce Sokrates as talking what was either nonsensical, or offensive to the feelings
of the Athenians: and Sokrates (in the Platonic Apology) complains that the Dikasts judged him, not according to what he had really said or done, but according to the impression made on them by this
dramatic picture. The Athenian Sophists would have equal right to complain of those critics, who not only speak of Euthyd&ecirc;mus and Dionysodorus with a degree of acrimony applicable only to
historical persons, but also describe them as representative types of Protagoras, Gorgias, and their disciples.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_27" href="#Footnotev2_21_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a></p>

Stallbaum, Steinhart, and others. He thinks moreover, that the polemical purpose of this dialogue is directed not against Protagoras or Gorgias, but against the Megarics and against Antisthenes, who
(so Schleiermacher supposes) had brought the attack upon themselves by attacking Plato first (Einleitung zum Euthyd. p. 404 seq.). Schleiermacher cannot make out who the two Sophists were personally,
but he conceives them as obscure persons, deserving no notice.</p>

<p>This is a conjecture which admits of no proof; but if any real victim is here intended by Plato, we may just as reasonably suppose Antisthenes as Protagoras.</p>

to use them.</span></p>

<p>The conversation of Sokrates with the youth Kleinias is <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page205" id="v2page205"></a>205</span>remarkable for its plainness and simplicity. His purpose is to
implant or inflame in the youth the aspiration and effort towards wisdom or knowledge (&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&alpha;, in its etymological sense). &ldquo;You, like
every one else, wish to do well or to be happy. The way to be happy is, to have many good things. Every one knows this: every one knows too, that among these good things, wealth is an indisputable
item:<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_28" href="#Footnotev2_21_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> likewise health, beauty, bodily activity, good birth, power over others, honour in our city, temperance,
justice, courage, wisdom, &amp;c. Good fortune does not count as a distinct item, because it resolves itself into wisdom.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_29" href="#Footnotev2_21_29"><span class=
"sp">29</span></a> &mdash; But it is not enough to have all these good things: we must not only have them but use them: moreover, we must use them not wrongly, but rightly. If we use them wrongly,
they will not produce their appropriate consequences. They will even make us more miserable than if we had them not, because the possession of them will prompt us to be active and meddlesome:
whereas, if we have them not, we shall keep in the back-ground and do little.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_30" href="#Footnotev2_21_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> But to use these good things rightly,
depends upon wisdom, knowledge, intelligence. It thus appears that the enumerated items are not really good, except on the assumption that they are under the guidance of intelligence: if they are
under the guidance of ignorance, they are not good; nay, they even produce more harm than good, since they are active instruments in the service of a foolish master.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_31" href=

for.</span></p>

<p>The argument of Sokrates, which I have thus abridged from the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, arrives at no solution: but it is nevertheless eminently suggestive, and puts the question in a way to receive
solution. What is the regal or political art which directs or regulates all others? A man has many different impulses, dispositions, qualities, aptitudes, advantages, possessions, &amp;c., which we
describe by saying that he is an artist, a general, a tradesman, clever, just, temperate, brave, strong, rich, powerful, &amp;c. But in the course of life, each particular situation has its different
exigencies, while the prospective future has its exigencies also. The whole man is one, with all these distinct and sometimes conflicting attributes: in following one impulse, he must resist others
&mdash; in turning his aptitudes to one object, he must turn them away from others &mdash; he must, as Plato says, distinguish the right use of his force from the wrong, by virtue of knowledge,
intelligence, reason. Such discriminating intelligence, which in this dialogue is called the Regal or political art, &mdash; what is the object of it? It is intelligence or knowledge, &mdash; But <i>
of what</i>? Not certainly of the way how each particular act is to be performed &mdash; how each particular end is to be attained. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page208" id="v2page208">
</a>208</span>Each of these separately is the object of some special knowledge. But the whole of a man&rsquo;s life is passed in a series of such particular acts, each of which is the object of some
special knowledge: what then remains as the object of Regal or political intelligence, upon which our happiness is said to depend? Or how can it have any object at all?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_19" id="Sidenotev2_21_19"></a> Comparison with other dialogues &mdash; Republic, Phil&ecirc;bus, Protagoras. The only distinct answer is found in the
Protagoras.</span></p>

<p>The question here raised is present to Plato&rsquo;s mind in other dialogues, and occurs under other words, as for example, What is good? Good is the object of the Regal or political intelligence;
but what is Good? In the Republic he raises this question, but declines to answer it, confessing that he could not make it intelligible to his hearers:<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_39" href=
"#Footnotev2_21_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> in the Gorgias, he takes pains to tell us what it <i>is not</i>: in the Phil&ecirc;bus, he does indeed tell us what it is, but in terms which need
explanation quite as much as the term which they are brought to explain. There is only one dialogue in which the question is answered affirmatively, in clear and unmistakable language, and with
considerable development &mdash; and that is, the Protagoras: where Sokrates asserts and proves at length, that Good is at the bottom identical with pleasure, and Evil with pain: that the measuring
or calculating intelligence is the truly regal art of life, upon which the attainment of Good depends: and that the object of that intelligence &mdash; the items which we are to measure, calculate,
and compare &mdash; is pleasures and pains, so as to secure to ourselves as much as possible of the former, and escape as much as possible of the latter.</p>

</div>

<p>In my remarks on the <a href="#Sidenotev2_23_67">Protagoras</a>, I shall state the view which I take of the doctrine laid down in that dialogue by Sokrates. Persons may think the answer
insufficient: most of the Platonic critics declare it to be absolutely wrong. But at any rate it is the only distinct answer which Plato ever gives, to the question raised by Sokrates in the
Euthyd&ecirc;mus and elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_20" id="Sidenotev2_21_20"></a> The talk of the two Sophists, though ironically admired while it is going on, is shown at the end to produce no real
admiration, but the contrary.</span></p>

<p>From the abstract just given of the argument of Sokrates in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, it will be seen to be serious and pertinent, though ending with a confession of failure. The observations placed
in contrast with it and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page209" id="v2page209"></a>209</span>ascribed to the two Sophists, are distinguished by being neither serious nor pertinent; but parodies of
debate for the most part, put together for the express purpose of appearing obviously silly to the reader. Plato keeps up the dramatic or ironical appearance, that they are admired and welcomed not
only by the hearers, but even by Sokrates himself. Nevertheless, it is made clear at the end that all this is nothing but irony, and that the talk which Plato ascribes to Euthyd&ecirc;mus and
Dionysodorus produced, according to his own showing, no sentiment of esteem for their abilities among the by-standers, but quite the reverse. Whether there were individual Sophists at Athens who
talked in that style, we can neither affirm nor deny: but that there were an established class of persons who did so, and made both money and reputation by it, we can securely deny. It is the more
surprising that the Platonic commentators should desire us to regard Euthyd&ecirc;mus and Dionysodorus as representative samples of a special class named Sophists, since one of the most eminent of
those commentators (Stallbaum),<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_40" href="#Footnotev2_21_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> both admits that Sokrates himself was generally numbered in the class and called by
the name and affirms also (incorrectly, in my opinion) that the interrogations of Sokrates, which in this dialogue stand contrasted with those of the two Sophists, do not enunciate the opinions
either of Sokrates or of Plato himself, but the opinions of these very Sophists, which Plato adopts and utters for the occasion.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_41" href="#Footnotev2_21_41"><span class=

&mdash; Aristotle&rsquo;s definition &mdash; no distinguishable line can be drawn between the Sophist and the Dialectician.</span></p>

<p>The received supposition that there were at Athens a class of men called Sophists who made money and reputation by obvious fallacies employed to bring about contradictions in dialogue &mdash;
appears to me to pervert the representations given of ancient philosophy. Aristotle defines a Sophist to be &ldquo;one who seeks to make money by apparent wisdom which is not real
wisdom&ldquo;:&mdash; the Sophist (he says) is an Eristic who, besides money-making, seeks for nothing but victory in debate and humiliation of his opponent:&mdash; Distinguishing the Dialectician
from the Sophist (he says), the Dialectician impugns or defends, by probable arguments, probable tenets &mdash; that is, tenets which are believed by a numerous public or by a few wise and eminent
individuals:&mdash; while the Sophist deals with tenets which are probable only in appearance and not in reality &mdash; that is to say, tenets which almost every one by the slightest attention
recognises as false.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_42" href="#Footnotev2_21_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> This definition is founded, partly on the personal character and purpose ascribed to the
Sophist: partly upon the distinction between apparent and real wisdom, assumed to be known and permanent. Now such pseudo-wisdom was declared by Sokrates to be the natural state of all mankind, even
the most eminent, which it was his mission to expose: moreover, the determination, what is to be comprised in this description, must depend upon the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page211" id=
"v2page211"></a>211</span>judges to whom it is submitted, since much of the works of Aristotle and Plato would come under the category, in the judgment of modern readers both vulgar and instructed.
But apart from this relative and variable character of the definition, when applied to philosophy generally &mdash; we may confidently assert, that there never was any real class of intellectual men,
in a given time or place, to whom it could possibly apply. Of individuals, the varieties are innumerable: but no professional body of men ever acquired gain or celebrity by maintaining theses, and
employing arguments, which every one could easily detect as false. Every man employs sophisms more or less; every man does so inadvertently, some do it by design also; moreover, almost every reasoner
does it largely, in the estimation of his opponents. No distinct line can be drawn between the Sophist and the Dialectician: the definition given by Aristotle applies to an ideal in his own mind, but
to no reality without: Protagoras and Prodikus no more correspond to it than Sokrates and Plato. Aristotle observes, with great truth, that all men are dialecticians and testers of reasoning, up to a
certain point: he might have added that they are all Sophists also, up to a certain point.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_43" href="#Footnotev2_21_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> Moreover, when he attempts
to found a scientific classification of intellectual processes upon a difference in the purposes of different practitioners &mdash; whether they employ the same process for money or display, or
beneficence, or mental satisfaction to themselves &mdash; this is altogether unphilosophical. The medical art is the same, whether employed to advise gratis, or in exchange for a fee.<a name=

multiplication of particular examples.</span></p>

<p>Though I maintain that no class of professional Sophists (in the meaning given to that term by the Platonic critics after Plato and Aristotle) ever existed &mdash; and though the distinction
between the paid and the gratuitous discourser is altogether unworthy to enter into the history of philosophy &mdash; yet I am not the less persuaded that the Platonic dialogue Euthyd&ecirc;mus, and
the treatise of Aristotle De Sophisticis Elenchis, are very striking and useful compositions. This last-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page212" id="v2page212"></a>212</span> treatise was
composed by Aristotle very much under the stimulus of the Platonic dialogue Euthyd&ecirc;mus, to which it refers several times &mdash; and for the purpose of distributing the variety of possible
fallacies under a limited number of general heads, each described by its appropriate characteristic, and represented by its illustrative type. Such attempt at arrangement &mdash; one of the many
valuable contributions of Aristotle to the theory of reasoning &mdash; is expressly claimed by him as his own. He takes a just pride in having been the first to introduce system where none had
introduced it before.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_45" href="#Footnotev2_21_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> No such system was known to Plato, who (in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus) enumerates a string of
fallacies one after another without any project of classifying them, and who presents them as it were in concrete, as applied by certain disputants in an imaginary dialogue. The purpose is, to make
these fallacies appear conspicuously in their character of fallacies: a purpose which is assisted by presenting the propounders of them as ridiculous and contemptible. The lively fancy of Plato
attaches suitable accessories to Euthyd&ecirc;mus and Dionysodorus. They are old men, who have been all their lives engaged in teaching rhetoric and tactics, but have recently taken to dialectic, and
acquired perfect mastery thereof without any trouble &mdash; who make extravagant promises &mdash; and who as talkers play into each other&rsquo;s hands, making a shuttlecock of the respondent, a
modest novice every way unsuitable for such treatment.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_23" id="Sidenotev2_21_23"></a> Aristotle (Soph. Elench.) attempts a classification of fallacies: Plato enumerates them without
classification.</span></p>

<p>Thus different is the Platonic manner, from the Aristotelian manner, of exposing fallacies. But those exhibited in the former appear as members of one or more among the classes framed by the
latter. The fallacies which we read in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus are chiefly verbal: but some are verbal, and something beyond.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, if we take the first sophism introduced by the two exhibitors, upon which they bring the youth Kleinias, by suitable questions, to declare successively both sides of the
alternative &mdash; &ldquo;Which of the two is it that learns, the wise or the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page213" id="v2page213"></a>213</span>ignorant?&rdquo; &mdash; Sokrates himself
elucidates it by pointing out that the terms used are equivocal:<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_46" href="#Footnotev2_21_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> You might answer it by using the language ascribed
to Dionysodorus in another part of this dialogue &mdash; &ldquo;Neither and Both&rdquo;.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_47" href="#Footnotev2_21_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> The like may be said about
the fallacy in page 284 D &mdash; &ldquo;Are there persons who speak of things as they are? Good men speak of things as they are: they speak of good men well, of bad men badly: therefore, of course,
they speak of stout men stoutly, and of hot men hotly. Ay! rejoins the respondent Ktesippus, angrily &mdash; they speak of cold men coldly, and say that they talk coldly.&rdquo;<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_21_48" href="#Footnotev2_21_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> These are fallacies of double meaning of words &mdash; or double construction of phrases: as we read also in page 287 D,
where the same Greek verb (&nu;&omicron;&epsilon;&#8150;&nu;) may be construed either to <i>think</i> or to <i>mean</i>: so that when Sokrates talks about what a predication <i>means</i> &mdash; the
Sophists ask him &mdash; &ldquo;Does anything <i>think</i>, except things having a soul? Did you ever know any predication that had a soul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, the two Sophists undertake to prove that Sokrates, as well as the youth Kleinias and indeed every one else, knows everything. &ldquo;Can any existing thing <i>be</i> that which it is, and
at the same time <i>not be</i> that which it is? &mdash; No. &mdash; You know some things? &mdash; Yes. &mdash; Then if you know, <i>you are knowing</i>? &mdash; Certainly. I am knowing of those

exposing fallacies is to exemplify the fallacy by particular cases, in which the conclusion proved is known <i>aliunde</i> to be false and absurd.</span></p>

<p>The Euthyd&ecirc;mus of Plato is memorable in the history of philosophy as the earliest known attempt to set out, and exhibit to attention, a string of fallacious modes of reasoning. Plato makes
them all absurd and ridiculous. He gives a caricature of a dialectic debate, not unworthy of his namesake Plato Comicus &mdash; or of Aristophanes, Swift, or Voltaire. The sophisms appear for the
most part so silly, as he puts them, that the reader asks himself how any one could have been ever imposed upon by such a palpable delusion? Yet such confidence is by no means justified. A sophism,
perfectly analogous in character to those which Plato here exposes to ridicule, may, in another case, easily escape detection from the hearer, and even from the reasoner himself. People are
constantly misled by fallacies arising from the same word bearing two senses, from double construction of the same phrase, from unconscious application of a <i>dictum secundum quid</i>, as if it were
a <i>dictum simpliciter</i>; from Petitio Principii, &amp;c., Ignoratio Elenchi, &amp;c. Neither Plato himself, nor Aristotle, can boast of escaping them.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_58" href=
"#Footnotev2_21_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> If these fallacies appear, in the examples chosen by Plato for the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, so obviously inconclusive that they can deceive no one &mdash;
the reason lies not in the premisses themselves, but in the particular conclusions to which they lead: which conclusions are known on other grounds to be false, and never to be seriously maintainable
by any person. Such conclusions as &mdash; &ldquo;Sokrates had no father: Sophroniskus, if father of Sokrates, was father of all men and all animals: In beating your dog, you beat your father: If you
know one thing, you know everything,&rdquo; &amp;c., being known <i>aliunde</i> to be false, prove that there has been some fallacy in the premisses whereby they have been established. Such cases
serve as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the antecedent process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page217" id="v2page217"></a>217</span> They make us aware of one mode of liability to error, and put
us on our guard against it in analogous cases. This is a valuable service, and all the more valuable, because the liability to error is real and widespread, even from fallacies perfectly analogous to
those which seem so silly under the particular exemplifications which Plato selects and exposes. Many of the illustrations of the Platonic Euthyd&ecirc;mus are reproduced by Aristotle in the Treatise
de Sophisticis Elenchis, together with other fallacies, discriminated with a certain method and system.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_59" href="#Footnotev2_21_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_30" id="Sidenotev2_21_30"></a> Mistake of supposing fallacies to have been invented and propagated by Athenian Sophists &mdash; they are inherent
inadvertencies and liabilities to error, in the ordinary process of thinking. Formal debate affords the best means of correcting them.</span></p>

<p>The true character of these fallacies is very generally overlooked by the Platonic critics, in their appreciation of the Euthyd&ecirc;mus; when they point our attention to the supposed tricks and
frauds of the persons whom they called Sophists, as well as to mischievous corruptions alleged to arise from Eristic or formal contentious debate. These critics speak as if they thought that such
fallacies were the special inventions of Athenian Sophists for the purposes of Athenian Eristic: as if such causes of error were inoperative on persons of ordinary honesty or intelligence, who never
consulted or heard the Sophists. It has been the practice of writers on logic, from Aristotle down to Whately, to represent logical fallacies as frauds devised and maintained by dishonest
practitioners, whose art Whately assimilates to that of jugglers.</p>

<p>This view of the case appears to me incomplete and misleading. It substitutes the rare and accidental in place of the constant and essential. The various sophisms, of which Plato in the
Euthyd&ecirc;mus gives the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, are not the inventions of Sophists. They are erroneous tendencies of the reasoning process, frequently incident to human thought and speech:
specimens of those ever-renewed &ldquo;inadvertencies of ordinary thinking&rdquo; (to recur to a phrase cited in my preface), which it is the peculiar mission of philosophy or &ldquo;reasoned
truth&rdquo; to rectify. Moreover the practice of formal debate, which is usually denounced with so much asperity &mdash; if it affords on some occasions opportunity to produce such fallacies,
presents not merely equal opportunity, but the only effective means, for exposing and confuting<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page218" id="v2page218"></a>218</span> them. Whately in his Logic,<a
name="FnAnchorv2_21_60" href="#Footnotev2_21_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> like Plato in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, when bringing these fallacies into open daylight in order that every one may detect
them, may enliven the theme by presenting them as the deliberate tricks of a Sophist. Doubtless they are so by accident: yet their essential character is that of infirmities incident to the <i>
intellectus sibi permissus</i>: operative at Athens before Athenian Sophists existed, and in other regions also, where these persons never penetrated.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_21_60" id="Footnotev2_21_60"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_21_60">60</a></span> Whately&rsquo;s Logic, ch. v. sect. 5. Though Whately, like other
logicians, keeps the Sophists in the foreground, as the fraudulent enemy who sow tares among that which would otherwise come up as a clean crop of wheat &mdash; yet he intimates also incidentally how
widespread and frequent such fallacies are, quite apart from dishonest design. He says &mdash; &ldquo;It seems by most persons to be taken for granted, that a Fallacy is to be dreaded merely as a
weapon fashioned and wielded by a skilful Sophist: or, if they allow that a man may with honest intentions slide into one, unconsciously, in the heat of <i>argument</i> &mdash; still they seem to
suppose, that where there is no <i>dispute</i>, there is no cause to dread Fallacy. Whereas there is much danger, even in what may be called <i>solitary reasoning</i>, of sliding unawares into some
Fallacy, by which one may be so far deceived as even to act upon the conclusion so obtained. By <i>solitary reasoning</i>, is meant the case in which we are not seeking for arguments to prove a given
question, but labouring to elicit from our previous stock of knowledge some useful inference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To speak of all the Fallacies that have ever been enumerated, as too glaring and obvious to need even being mentioned &mdash; because the simple instances given in books, and there stated
in the plainest and consequently most easily detected form, are such as (in that form) would deceive no one &mdash; this, surely, shows either extreme weakness or extreme unfairness.&rdquo; &mdash;
Aristotle himself makes the same remark as Whately &mdash; That the man who is easily taken in by a Fallacy advanced by another, will be easily misled by the like Fallacy in his own solitary
reasoning. Sophist. Elench. 16, 175, a. 10.</p>

<p>The wide diffusion and constant prevalence of such infirmities is attested not less by Sokrates in his last speech, wherein he declares real want of knowledge and false persuasion of knowledge, to
be universal, the mission of his life being to expose them, though he could not correct them &mdash; than by Bacon in his reformatory projects, where he enumerates the various Idola worshipped by the
human intellect, and the false tendencies acquired &ldquo;<i>in prim&acirc; digestione mentis</i>&ldquo;. The psychological analysis of the sentiment of belief with its different sources, given in
Mr. Alexander Bain&rsquo;s work on the Emotions and the Will, shows how this takes place; and exhibits true or sound belief, in so far as it ever is acquired, as an acquisition only attained after
expulsion of earlier antecedent error.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_61" href="#Footnotev2_21_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> Of such error, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page219" id="v2page219">
</a>219</span>of the different ways in which apparent evidence is mistaken for real evidence, a comprehensive philosophical exposition is farther given by Mr. John Stuart Mill, in the fifth book of
his System of Logic, devoted to the subject of Fallacies. Every variety of erroneous procedure is referable to some one or more of the general heads of Fallacy there enumerated. It is the Fallacies
of Ratiocination, of which the two Sophists, in the Platonic Euthyd&ecirc;mus, are made to exhibit specimens: and when we regard such Fallacies, as one branch among several in a complete logical
scheme, we shall see at once that they are not inventions of the Athenian Sophists &mdash; still less inventions for the purpose of Eristic or formal debate. For every one of these Fallacies is of a
nature to ensnare men, and even to ensnare them more easily, in the common, informal, conversation of life &mdash; or in their separate thoughts. Besides mistakes on matters of fact, the two main

particular conclusions, which disposes persons to accept any apparent evidence, favourable to such conclusion, as if it, were real evidence: next, the careless and elliptical character of common
speech, in which some parts of the evidence are merely insinuated, and other parts altogether left out. It is this last circumstance which gives occasion to the very extensive class of Fallacies
called by Mr. Mill Fallacies of Confusion: a class so large, that the greater number of Fallacies might plausibly be brought under it.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_62" href="#Footnotev2_21_62"><span class=

and growth of Belief, in Mr. Bain&rsquo;s work, &lsquo;Emotions and Will,&rsquo; p. 568 seq. After laying down the fundamental characteristic of Belief, as referable altogether to intended action,
either certain to come, or contingent under supposed circumstances, and after enumerating the different Sources of Belief. &mdash; 1. Intuitive or Instinctive. 2. Experience. 3. The Influence of the
Emotions (sect. x. p. 579) &mdash; Mr. Bain says: &ldquo;Having in our constitution primordial fountains of activity in the spontaneous and voluntary impulses, we follow the first clue that
experience gives us, and accept the indication with the whole force of these natural promptings. Being under the strongest impulses to act somehow, an animal accepts any lead that is presented, and
if successful, abides by that lead with unshaken confidence. This is that instinct of credulity so commonly attributed to the infant mind. It is not the single instance, or the repetition of two or
three, that makes up the strong tone of confidence; it is the mind&rsquo;s own active determination, finding some definite vent in the gratification of its ends, and abiding by the discovery with the
whole energy of the character, until the occurrence of some check, failure, or contradiction. The force of belief, therefore, is not one rising from zero to a full development by slow degrees,
according to the length of the experience. We must treat it rather as a strong primitive manifestation, derived from the natural activity of the system, and taking its direction and rectification
from experience (p. 583). The anticipation of nature, so strenuously repudiated by Bacon, is the offspring of this characteristic of the mental system. With the active tendency at its maximum, and
the exercise of intelligence and acquired knowledge at the minimum, there can issue nothing but a quantity of rash enterprises. The respectable name <i>generalisation</i>, implying the best products
of enlightened scientific research, has also a different meaning, expressing one of the most erroneous impulses and crudest determinations of untutored human nature. To extend some familiar and
narrow experience, so as to comprehend cases the most distant, is a piece of mere reckless instinct, demanding severe discipline for its correction. I have mentioned the case of our supposing all
other minds constituted like our own. The veriest infant has got this length in the career of fallacy. Sound belief, instead of being a pacific and gentle growth, is in reality the battering of a
series of strongholds, the conquering of a country in hostile occupation. This is a fact common both to the individual and to the race. Observation is unanimous on the point. It will probably be long
ere the last of the delusions attributable to this method of believing first and proving afterwards can be eradicated from humanity.&rdquo; [3rd ed., p. 505 seq.]</p>

following citation from Hobbes&rsquo;s &lsquo;Logica&rsquo;. &ldquo;Errare non modo affirmando et negando, sed etiam in sentiendo, et in tacit&acirc; hominum cogitatione, contingit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Mill points out forcibly both the operation of moral or emotional bias in perverting the intellect, and causing sophisms or fallacies to produce conviction; and the increased chance afforded
for the success of a sophism by the suppression of part of the premisses, which is unavoidable in informal discussions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bias is not a direct source of wrong conclusions (v. 1-3). We cannot believe a proposition only by wishing, or only by dreading, to believe it. Bias acts indirectly by placing the
intellectual grounds of belief in an incomplete or distorted shape before a man&rsquo;s eyes. It makes him shrink from the irksome labour of a rigorous induction. It operates too by making him look
out eagerly for reasons, or apparent reasons, to support opinions which are conformable, or resist those which are repugnant, to his interests or feelings; and when the interests or feelings are
common to great numbers of persons, reasons are accepted or pass current which would not for a moment be listened to in that character, if the conclusion had nothing more powerful than its reasons to
speak in its behalf. The natural or acquired prejudices of mankind are perpetually throwing up philosophical theories, the sole recommendation of which consists in the premisses which they afford for
proving cherished doctrines, or justifying favourite feelings; and when any one of these theories has become so thoroughly discredited as no longer to serve the purpose, another is always ready to
take its place.&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Though the opinions of the generality of mankind, when not dependent upon mere habit and inculcation, have their root much more in the inclinations than in the
intellect, it is a necessary condition to the triumph of the moral bias that it should first pervert the understanding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again in v. 2, 3. &ldquo;It is not in the nature of bad reasoning to express itself unambiguously. When a sophist, whether he is imposing upon himself or attempting to impose upon others, can be
constrained to throw his argument into so distinct a form, it needs, in a large number of cases, no farther exposure. In all arguments, everywhere but in the schools, some of the links are
suppressed: <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, when the arguer either intends to deceive, or is a lame and inexpert thinker, little accustomed to bring his reasoning processes to any test; and it is in those
steps of the reasoning which are made in this tacit and half-conscious, or even wholly unconscious, manner, that the error oftenest lurks. In order to detect the fallacy the proposition thus silently
assumed must be supplied, but the reasoner, most likely, has never really asked himself what he was assuming; his confuter, unless permitted to extort it from him by the Socratic mode of
interrogation, must himself judge what the suppressed premiss ought to be, in order to support the conclusion.&rdquo; Mr. Mill proceeds to illustrate this confusion by an excellent passage cited from
Whately&rsquo;s &lsquo;Logic&rsquo;. I may add, that Aristotle himself makes a remark substantially the same &mdash; That the same fallacy may be referred to one general head or to another, according
to circumstances. Sophist. Elench. 33, 182, b. 10.</p>

and confuting fallacies.</span></p>

<p>We thus see not only that the fallacious agencies are self-operative, generating their own weeds in the common soil of human thought and speech, without being planted by Athenian Sophists or
watered by Eristic &mdash; but that this very Eristic affords the best means of restraining their diffusion. It is only in formal debate that the disputant can be forced to make clear to himself and
declare explicitly to others, without reserve or omission, all the premisses upon which his conclusion rests &mdash; that every part of these premisses becomes liable to immediate challenge by an
opponent &mdash; that the question comes distinctly under consideration, what is or is not sufficient evidence &mdash; that the premisses of one argument can be compared with the premisses of
another, so that if in the former you are tempted to acquiesce in them as sufficient because you have a bias favourable to the conclusion, in the latter you may be made to feel that they are <i>
insufficient</i>, because the conclusion which they prove is one which you know to be untrue (<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>). The habit of formal debate (called by those who do not like it, Eristic<a
name="FnAnchorv2_21_63" href="#Footnotev2_21_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a>) is thus an indispensable condition both for the exposure and confutation of fallacies, which exist quite independent
of that habit &mdash; owing their rise and prevalence to deep-seated psychological causes.</p>

Sophists) as if that name designated a known and definite class of persons. This is altogether misleading. The term is vituperative, and was applied by different persons according to their own
tastes.</p>

<p>Ueberweg remarks with great justice, that Isokrates called all speculators on philosophy by the name of Eristics. &ldquo;Als ob jener Rhetor nicht (wie ja doch Spengel selbst gut nachgewiesen hat)
alle und jede Spekulation mit dem Nahmen der Eristik bezeichnete.&rdquo; (Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die Zeitfolge der Plat. Schriften, p. 257.) In reference to the distinction which Aristotle attempts
to draw between Dialectic and Eristic &mdash; the former legitimate, the latter illegitimate &mdash; we must remark that even in the legitimate Dialectic the purpose prominent in his mind is that of
victory over an opponent. He enjoins that you are not only to guard against your opponent, lest he should out-man&oelig;uvre you, but you are to conceal and disguise the sequence of your questions so
as to out-man&oelig;uvre him. &Chi;&rho;&#8052; &delta;&rsquo; &#8005;&pi;&epsilon;&rho; &phi;&upsilon;&lambda;&#940;&tau;&tau;&epsilon;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;

Sophisticis Elenchis.</span></p>

<p>Without the experience acquired by this habit of dialectic debate at Athens, Plato could not have composed his Euthyd&ecirc;mus, exhibiting a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of several verbal
fallacies &mdash; nor could we have had the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page222" id="v2page222"></a>222</span>logical theories of Aristotle, embodied in the Analytica and Topica with its annexed
treatise De Sophisticis Elenchis, in which various fallacies are discriminated and classified. These theories, and the corollaries connected with them, do infinite honour to the comprehensive
intellect of Aristotle: but he could not have conceived them without previous study of the ratiocinative process. He, as the first theorizer, must have had before him abundant arguments explicitly
laid out, and contested, or open to be contested, at every step by an opponent.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_64" href="#Footnotev2_21_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> Towards such habit of formal
argumentation, a strong repugnance was felt by many of the Athenian public, as there is among modern readers generally: but those who felt thus, had probably little interest in the speculations
either of Plato or of Aristotle. That the Platonic critics should themselves feel this same repugnance, seems to me not consistent with their admiration for the great dialectician and logician of
antiquity: nor can I at all subscribe to their view, when they present to us the inherent infirmities of the human intellect as factitious distempers generated by the habit of formal debate, and by
the rapacity of Protagoras, Prodikus, and others.</p>

<p>I think it probable that the dialogue of Euthyd&ecirc;mus, as far as the point to which I have brought it (<i>i.e.</i>, where Sokrates finishes his recital to Kriton of the conversation which he
had had with the two Sophists), was among the most popular of all the Platonic dialogues: not merely because of its dramatic vivacity and charm of expression, but because it would be heartily
welcomed by the numerous enemies of Dialectic at Athens. We must remember that in the estimation of most persons at Athens, Dialectic included Sokrates and all the <i>viri Sokratici</i> (Plato among
them), just as much as the persons called Sophists. The discreditable picture here given of Euthyd&ecirc;mus and Dionysodorus, would be considered as telling against Dialectic and the Sokratic
Elenchus generally: while the rhetors, and others who dealt in long continuous discourse, would treat it as a blow <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page223" id="v2page223"></a>223</span>inflicted
upon the rival art of dialogue, by the professor of the dialogue himself. In Plato&rsquo;s view, the dialogue was the special and appropriate manifestation of philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_35" id="Sidenotev2_21_35"></a> Epilogue of Plato to the Dialogue, trying to obviate this inference by opponents &mdash; Conversation between Sokrates
and Kriton.</span></p>

<p>That the natural effect of the picture here drawn by Plato, was, to justify the antipathy of those who hated philosophy &mdash; we may see by the epilogue which Plato has thought fit to annex: an
epilogue so little in harmony with what has preceded, that we might almost imagine it to be an afterthought &mdash; yet obviously intended to protect philosophy against imputations. Sokrates having
concluded the recital, in his ironical way, by saying that he intended to become a pupil under the two Sophists, and by inviting Kriton to be a pupil along with him &mdash; Kriton replies by saying
that he is anxious to obtain instruction from any one who can give it, but that he has no sympathy with Euthyd&ecirc;mus, and would rather be refuted by him, than learn from him to refute in such a
manner. Kriton proceeds to report to Sokrates the remarks of a by-stander (an able writer of discourses for the Dikastery) who had heard all that passed; and who expressed his surprise that Sokrates
could have remained so long listening to such nonsense, and manifesting so much deference for a couple of foolish men. Nevertheless (continued the by-stander) this couple are among the most powerful
talkers of the day upon philosophy. This shows you how worthless a thing philosophy is: prodigious fuss, with contemptible result &mdash; men careless what they say, and carping at every word that
they hear.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_65" href="#Footnotev2_21_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Now, Sokrates (concludes Kriton), this man is wrong for depreciating philosophy, and all others who depreciate it are wrong also. But he was right in blaming you, for disputing with such a couple
before a large crowd.</p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What kind of person is this censor of philosophy? Is he a powerful speaker himself in the Dikastery? Or is he only a composer of discourses to be spoken by others? <i>

&mdash; Disparagement of persons half-philosophers, half-politicians.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; I understand the man. He belongs to that class whom Prodikus describes as the border-men between philosophy and politics. Persons of this class account themselves the wisest
of mankind, and think farther that besides being such in reality, they are also admired as such by many: insomuch that the admiration for them would be universal, if it were not for the professors of
philosophy. Accordingly they fancy, that if they could once discredit these philosophers, the prize of glory would be awarded to themselves, without controversy, by every one: they being in truth the
wisest men in society, though liable, if ever they are caught in dialectic debate, to be overpowered and humbled by men like Euthyd&ecirc;mus.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_67" href="#Footnotev2_21_67"><span
class="sp">67</span></a> They have very plausible grounds for believing in their own wisdom, since they pursue both philosophy and politics to a moderate extent, as far as propriety enjoins; and thus
pluck the fruit of wisdom without encountering either dangers or contests. <i>Krit.</i> &mdash; What do you say to their reasoning, Sokrates? It seems to me specious. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Yes, it is
specious, but not well founded. You cannot easily persuade them, though nevertheless it is true, that men who take a line mid-way between two pursuits, are <i>better</i> than either, if both pursuits
be bad &mdash; <i>worse</i> than either, if both pursuits be good, but tending to different ends &mdash; <i>better</i> than one and <i>worse</i> than the other, if one of the pursuits be bad and the
other good &mdash; <i>better</i> than both, if both be bad, but tending to different ends. Such being the case, if the pursuit of philosophy and that of active politics be both of them good, but
tending to different objects, these men are inferior to the pursuers of one as well as of the other: if one be good, the other bad, they are worse than the pursuers of the former, better than the
pursuers of the latter: if both be bad, they are better than either. Now I am sure that these men themselves account both philosophy and politics to be good. Accordingly, they are inferior both to
philosophers and politicians:<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_68" href="#Footnotev2_21_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> they occupy only the third rank, though they pretend to be in the first. While <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page225" id="v2page225"></a>225</span>we pardon such a pretension, and refrain from judging these men severely, we must nevertheless recognise them for such as they really
are. We must be content with every one, who announces any scheme of life, whatever it be, coming within the limits of intelligence, and who pursues his work with persevering resolution.<a name=

of Dialectic and philosophy.</span></p>

<p>The first part of this epilogue, which I have here given in abridgment, has a bearing very different from the rest of the dialogue, and different also from most of the other Platonic dialogues. In
the epilogue, Euthyd&ecirc;mus is cited as the representative of true dialectic and philosophy: the opponents of philosophy are represented as afraid of being put down by Euthyd&ecirc;mus: whereas,
previously, he had been depicted as contemptible, &mdash; as a man whose manner of refuting opponents was more discreditable to himself than to the opponent refuted; and who had no chance of success
except among hearers like himself. We are not here told that Euthyd&ecirc;mus was a bad specimen of philosophers, and that there were others better, by the standard of whom philosophy ought to be
judged. On the contrary, we find him here announced by Sokrates as among those dreaded by men adverse to philosophy, &mdash; and as not undeserving of that epithet which the semi-philosopher cited by
Kriton applies to &ldquo;one of the most powerful champions of the day&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Plato, therefore, after having applied his great dramatic talent to make dialectic debate ridiculous, and thus said much to gratify its enemies &mdash; changes his battery, and says something
against these enemies, without reflecting whether it is consistent or no with what had preceded. Before the close, however, he comes again into consistency with the tone of the earlier part, in the
observation which he assigns to Kriton, that most of the professors of philosophy are worthless; to which Sokrates rejoins that this is not less true of all other professions. The concluding
inference is, that philosophy is to be judged, not by its professors but by itself; and that Kriton must examine it for himself, and either pursue it or leave it alone, according as his own
convictions dictated.</p>

<p>This is a valuable admonition, and worthy of Sokrates, laying full stress as it does upon the conscientious conviction which the person examining may form for himself. But it is no answer to the
question of Kriton; who says that he had already heard from Sokrates, and was himself convinced, that philosophy was of first-rate importance &mdash; and that he only desired to learn where he could
find teachers to forward the progress of his son in it. As in so many other dialogues, Plato leaves the problem started, but <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page227" id="v2page227">
</a>227</span>unsolved. The impulse towards philosophy being assured, those who feel it ask Plato in what direction they are to move towards it. He gives no answer. He can neither perform the service
himself, nor recommend any one else, as competent. We shall find such silence made matter of pointed animadversion, in the fragment called Kleitophon.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_39" id="Sidenotev2_21_39"></a> Who is the person here intended by Plato, half-philosopher, half-politician? Is it Isokrates?</span></p>

<p>The person, whom Kriton here brings forward as the censor of Sokrates and the enemy of philosophy, is peculiarly marked. In general, the persons whom Plato ranks as enemies of philosophy are the
rhetors and politicians: but the example here chosen is not comprised in either of these classes: it is a semi-philosopher, yet a writer of discourses for others. Schleiermacher, Heindorf, and
Spengel, suppose that Isokrates is the person intended: Winckelmann thinks it is Thrasymachus: others refer it to Lysias, or Theodorus of Byzantium:<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_73" href=
"#Footnotev2_21_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a> Socher and Stallbaum doubt whether any special person is intended, or any thing beyond some supposed representative of a class described by
attributes. I rather agree with those who refer the passage to Isokrates. He might naturally be described as one steering a middle course between philosophy and rhetoric: which in fact he himself
proclaims in the Oration De Permutatione, and which agrees with the language of Plato in the dialogue Ph&aelig;drus, where Isokrates is mentioned by name along with Lysias. In the Ph&aelig;drus,
moreover, Plato speaks of Isokrates with unusual esteem, especially as a favourable contrast with Lysias, and as a person who, though not yet a philosopher, may be expected to improve, so as in no
long time to deserve that appellation.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_74" href="#Footnotev2_21_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> We <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page228" id="v2page228"></a>228</span>must
remember that Plato in the Ph&aelig;drus attacks by name, and with considerable asperity, first Lysias, next Theodorus and Thrasymachus the rhetors &mdash; all three persons living and of note. Being
sure to offend all these, Plato might well feel disposed to avoid making an enemy of Isokrates at the same time, and to except him honourably by name from the vulgar professors of rhetoric. In the
Euthyd&ecirc;mus (where the satire is directed not against the rhetors, but against their competitors the dialecticians or pseudo-dialecticians) he had no similar motive to address compliments to
Isokrates: respecting whom he speaks in a manner probably more conformable to his real sentiments, as the unnamed representative of a certain type of character &mdash; a semi-philosopher, fancying
himself among the first men in Athens, and assuming unwarrantable superiority over the genuine philosopher; but entitled to nothing more than a decent measure of esteem, such as belonged to sincere
mediocrity of intelligence.</p>

<p>Heindorf, in endeavouring to explain the difference between Plato&rsquo;s language in the Ph&aelig;drus and in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus respecting Isokrates, assumes as a matter beyond question the
theory of Schleiermacher, that the Ph&aelig;drus was composed during Plato&rsquo;s early years. I have already intimated my may dissent from this theory.</p>

<p>I have already observed that I do not agree with Schleiermacher and the other critics who rank the Ph&aelig;drus as the earliest or even among the earliest compositions of Plato. That it is of
much later composition I am persuaded, but of what particular date can only be conjectured. The opinion of K. F. Hermann, Stallbaum, and others, that it was composed about the time when Plato began
his school at Athens (387-386 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) is sufficiently probable.</p>

<p>The Euthyd&ecirc;mus may be earlier or may be later than the Ph&aelig;drus. I incline to think it later. The opinion of Stallbaum (resting upon the mention of Alkibiad&ecirc;s, p. 275 A), that it
was composed in or before 404 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, appears to me untenable (Stallbaum, Proleg. p. 64). Plato would not be likely to introduce Sokrates speaking of Alkibiad&ecirc;s as a
deceased person, whatever time the dialogue was composed. Nor can I agree with Steinhart, who refers it to 402 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Einleitung, p. 26). Ueberweg (Untersuch. &uuml;ber die
Zeitfolge der Plat. Schr. pp. 265-267) considers the Euthyd&ecirc;mus later (but not much later) than the Ph&aelig;drus, subsequent to the establishment of the Platonic school at Athens (387-386
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) This seems to me more probable than the contrary.</p>

<p>Schleiermacher, in arranging the Platonic dialogues, ranks the Euthyd&ecirc;mus as an immediate sequel to the Menon, and as presupposing both Gorgias and The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (Einl. pp. 400-401).
Socher agrees in this opinion, but Steinhart rejects it (Einleit. p. 26), placing the Euthyd&ecirc;mus immediately after the Protagoras, and immediately before the Menon and the Gorgias; according to
him, Euthyd&ecirc;mus, Menon, and Gorgias, form a well marked Trilogy.</p>

<p>Neither of these arrangements rests upon any sufficient reasons. The chronological order cannot be determined.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_21_40" id="Sidenotev2_21_40"></a> Variable feeling at different times, between Plato and Isokrates.</span></p>

<p>That there prevailed at different times different sentiments, more or less of reciprocal esteem or reciprocal jealousy, between Plato and Isokrates, ought not to be matter of surprise. Both of
them were celebrated teachers of Athens, each in his own manner, during the last forty years of Plato&rsquo;s life: both of them enjoyed the favour of foreign princes, and received pupils from
outlying, sometimes distant, cities &mdash; from Bosphorus and Cyprus in the East, and from Sicily in the West. We know moreover that during the years immediately preceding Plato&rsquo;s death (347
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), his pupil Aristotle, then rising into importance as a teacher of rhetoric, was engaged in acrimonious literary warfare, seemingly <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page229" id="v2page229"></a>229</span>of his own seeking, with Isokrates (then advanced in years) and some of the Isokratean pupils. The little which we learn concerning the literary and
philosophical world of Athens, represents it as much distracted by feuds and jealousies. Isokrates on his part has in his compositions various passages which appear to allude (no name being
mentioned) to Plato among others, in a tone of depreciation.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_75" href="#Footnotev2_21_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a></p>

<p>Isokrates seems, as far as we can make out, to have been in early life, like Lysias, a composer of speeches to be spoken by clients in the Dikastery. This lucrative profession was tempting, since
his family had been nearly ruined during the misfortunes of Athens at the close of the Peloponnesian war. Having gained reputation by such means, Isokrates became in his mature age a teacher of
Rhetoric, and a composer of discourses, not for private use by clients, but for the general reader, on political or educational topics. In this character, he corresponded to the description given by
Plato in the Euthyd&ecirc;mus: being partly a public adviser, partly a philosopher. But the general principle under which Plato here attacks him, though conforming to the doctrine of the Platonic
Republic, is contrary to that of Plato in other dialogues, &ldquo;You must devote yourself either wholly to philosophy, or wholly to politics: a mixture of the two is worse than either&ldquo; &mdash;
this agrees with the Republic, wherein Plato enjoins upon each man one special and exclusive pursuit, as well as with the doctrine maintained against Kallikl&ecirc;s in the Gorgias &mdash; but it
differs from the Ph&aelig;drus, where he ascribes the excellence of Perikles as a statesmen and rhetor, to the fact of his having acquired a large tincture of philosophy.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_76"
href="#Footnotev2_21_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a> Cicero quotes this last passage as applicable to his own distinguished career, a combination of philosophy with politics.<a name=

have dissented from it also.</p>

<p>As a doctrine of universal application, in fact, it cannot be <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page230" id="v2page230"></a>230</span>defended. The opposite scheme of life (which is maintained by
Isokrates in De Permutatione and by Kallikl&ecirc;s in the Platonic Gorgias)<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_78" href="#Footnotev2_21_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> &mdash; that philosophy is to be
attentively studied in the earlier years of life as an intellectual training, to arm the mind with knowledge and capacities which may afterwards be applied to the active duties of life &mdash; is at
least equally defensible, and suits better for other minds of a very high order. Not only Xenophon and other distinguished Greeks, but also most of the best Roman citizens, held the opinion which
Plato in the Gorgias ascribes to Kallikl&ecirc;s and reprobates through the organ of Sokrates &mdash; That philosophical study, if prolonged beyond what was necessary for this purpose of adequate
intellectual training, and if made the permanent occupation of life, was more hurtful than beneficial.<a name="FnAnchorv2_21_79" href="#Footnotev2_21_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> Certainly, a
man may often fail in the attempt to combine philosophy with active politics. No one failed in such a career more lamentably than Dion, the friend of Plato &mdash; and Plato himself, when he visited
Sicily to second Dion. Moreover Alkibiad&ecirc;s and Kritias were cited by Anytus and the other accusers of Sokrates as examples of the like mischievous conjunction. But on the other hand, Archytas
at Tarentum (another friend of Plato and philosopher) administered his native city with success, as long (seemingly) as Perikl&ecirc;s administered Athens. Such men as these two are nowise inferior
either to the special <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page231" id="v2page231"></a>231</span>philosopher or to the special politician. Plato has laid down an untenable generality, in this passage of
the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, in order to suit a particular point which he wished to make against Isokrates, or against the semi-philosopher indicated, whoever else he may have been.</p>

alludes, are characterised by one of the Platonic critics as &ldquo;jene oberfl&auml;chlichen und schw&auml;chlichen Naturen die sich zwischen beiden Richtungen stellen, und zur Erreichung
selbsts&uuml;chtiger und beschr&auml;nkter Zwecke von beiden aufnehmen was sie verstehen und was ihnen gef&auml;llt&rdquo; (Steinhart, Einleit. p. 25). On the other hand we find in Tacitus a striking
passage respecting the studies of Agricola in his youth at Massilia. &ldquo;Memori&acirc; teneo, solitum ipsum narrare, se in prim&acirc; juvent&acirc; studium philosophi&aelig; acrius, ultra quam
concessum Romano ac senatori, hausisse &mdash; ni prudentia matris incensum ac flagrantem animum exercuisset: Scilicet sublime et erectum ingenium, pulchritudinem ac speciem excels&aelig;
magn&aelig;que glori&aelig; vehementius quam laut&eacute; appetebat: retinuitque, quod est difficillimum, ex sapienti&acirc; modum&ldquo; (Vit. Agr. c. 4).</p>

<p>Tacitus expresses himself in the same manner about the purpose with which Helvidius Priscus applied himself to philosophy (Hist. iv. 6): &ldquo;non, ut plerique, ut nomine magnifico segne otium
velaret, sed quo constantior adversus fortuita rempublicam capesseret&ldquo;.</p>

<p>Aulus Gellius (x. 22), who cites the doctrine which Plato ascribes to Kallikl&ecirc;s in the Gorgias (about the propriety of confining philosophy to the function of training and preparation for
active pursuits), tries to make out that this was Plato&rsquo;s own opinion.</p>

<p>This dialogue is carried on between Sokrates and Menon, a man of noble family, wealth, and political influence, in the Thessalian city of Larissa. He is supposed to have previously frequented, in
his native city, the lectures and society of the rhetor Gorgias.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_1" href="#Footnotev2_22_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The name and general features of Menon are probably
borrowed from the Thessalian military officer, who commanded a division of the Ten Thousand Greeks, and whose character Xenophon depicts in the Anabasis: but there is nothing in the Platonic dialogue
to mark that meanness and perfidy which the Xenophontic picture indicates. The conversation between Sokrates and Menon is interrupted by two episodes: in the first of these, Sokrates questions an
unlettered youth, the slave of Menon: in the second, he is brought into conflict with Anytus, the historical accuser of the historical Sokrates.</p>

<p>Many commentators here speak as if such disclaimer on the part of Sokrates had reference merely to certain impudent pretensions to universal knowledge on the part of the Sophists. But this (as I
have before remarked) is a misconception of the Sokratic or Platonic point of view. The matter which Sokrates proclaims that <i>he</i> does not know, is, what, not Sophists alone, but every one else
also, professes to know well. Sokrates stands alone in avowing that he does not know it, and that he can find no one else who knows. Menon treats the question as one of no difficulty &mdash; one on
which confessed ignorance was discreditable. &ldquo;What!&ldquo; says Menon, &ldquo;am I really to state respecting you, that you do not know what virtue is?&rdquo; The man who makes such a
confession will be looked upon by his neighbours with surprise and displeasure &mdash; not to speak of probable consequences yet worse. He is one whom the multifarious agencies employed by King Nomos
(which we shall find described more at length in the Protagoras) have failed to mould into perfect and uninquiring conformity, and he is still in process of examination to form a judgment for
himself.</p>

<p>But (replies Sokrates) are they not all the same, <i>quatenus</i> virtue? Health, <i>quatenus</i> Health, is the same in a man or a woman: is not the case similar with virtue? <i>Menon.</i>
&mdash; Not exactly similar. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How so? Though there are many diverse virtues, have not all of them one and the same form in common, through the communion of which they <i>are</i>
virtues? In answer to my question, you ought to declare what this common form is. Thus, both the man who administers the city, and the woman who administers the house, must act both of them with
justice and moderation. Through the same qualities, both the one and the other are good. There is thus some common constituent: tell me what it is, according to you and Gorgias? <i>Menon.</i> &mdash;
It is to be competent to exercise command over men.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_6" href="#Footnotev2_22_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But that will not suit for the virtue of a
child or a slave. Moreover, must we not superadd the condition, to command justly, and not unjustly? <i>Menon.</i> &mdash; I think so: justice is virtue. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Is it virtue &mdash; or
is it one particular variety of virtue?<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_7" href="#Footnotev2_22_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> <i>Menon.</i> &mdash; How do you mean? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Just as if I were to
say about roundness, that it is not figure, but a particular variety of figure: because there are other figures besides roundness. <i>Menon.</i> &mdash; Very true: I say too, that there are other
virtues besides justice &mdash; namely, courage, moderation, wisdom, magnanimity, and several others also. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; We are thus still in the same predicament. In looking for one virtue,
we have found many; but we cannot find that one form which runs through them all. <i>Menon.</i> &mdash; I cannot at present tell what that one is.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_8" href=

<p>Sokrates proceeds to illustrate his meaning by the analogies of figure and colour. You call <i>round</i> a figure, and <i>square</i> a figure: you call <i>white</i> and <i>black</i> both colour,
the one as much as the other, though they are unlike and even opposite.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_9" href="#Footnotev2_22_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> Tell me, What is this same common figure and

"FnAnchorv2_22_10" href="#Footnotev2_22_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Menon cannot answer, and Sokrates answers his own question. He gives a general definition, first of figure, next of colour.
He first defines figure in a way which implies colour to be known. This is pointed out; and he then admits that in a good definition, suitable to genuine dialectical investigation, nothing should be
implied as known, except what the respondent admits himself to know. Figure and colour are both defined suitably to this condition.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_11" href="#Footnotev2_22_11"><span class=

<p>All this preliminary matter seems to be intended for the purpose of getting the question clearly conceived as a general question &mdash; of exhibiting and eliminating the narrow and partial
conceptions which unconsciously substitute themselves in the mind, in place of that which ought to be conceived as a generic whole &mdash; and of clearing up what is required in a good definition. A
generic whole, including various specific portions distinguishable from each other, was at that time little understood by any one. There existed no grammar, nor any rules of logic founded on analysis
of the intellectual processes. To predicate of the genus what was true only of the species &mdash; to predicate as distinctively characterizing the species, what is true of the whole genus in which
it is contained &mdash; to lose the integrity of the genus in its separate parcels or fragments<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_12" href="#Footnotev2_22_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> &mdash; these were
errors which men had never yet been expressly taught to avoid. To assign the one common meaning, constituent of or connoted by a generic term, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page236" id=
"v2page236"></a>236</span>had never yet been put before them as a problem. Such preliminary clearing of the ground is instructive even now, when formal and systematic logic has become more or less
familiar: but in the time of Plato, it must have been indispensably required, to arrive at a full conception of any general question.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_13" href="#Footnotev2_22_13"><span class=

reflect high credit on Plato, when we regard them as an intellectual or prop&aelig;deutic discipline, forcing upon hearers an attention to useful logical distinctions at a time when there existed no
systematic grammar or logic. But surely they must appear degraded, as they are presented in the Prolegomena of Stallbaum, and by some other critics. We are there told that Plato&rsquo;s main purpose
in this dialogue was to mock and jeer the Sophists and their pupil, and that for this purpose Sokrates is made to employ not his own arguments but arguments borrowed from the Sophists themselves
&mdash; &ldquo;ut callid&eacute; suam ipsius rationem occultare existimandus sit, quo magis illudat Sophistarum alumnum&rdquo; (p. 15). &ldquo;Qu&aelig; quidem argumentatio&rdquo; (that of Sokrates)
&ldquo;admodum cavendum est ne pro Socratic&acirc; vel Platonic&acirc; accipiatur. Est enim prorsus ad mentem Sophistarum aliorumque id genus hominum comparata,&rdquo; &amp;c. (p. 16). Compare pp.
12-13 seq.</p>

<p>The Sophists undoubtedly had no distinct consciousness, any more than other persons, of these logical distinctions, which were then for the first pressed forcibly upon attention.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_7" id="Sidenotev2_22_7"></a> Definition of virtue given by Menon: Sokrates pulls it to pieces.</span></p>

<p>Menon having been thus made to understand the formal requisites for a definition, gives as his definition of virtue the phrase of some lyric poet &mdash; &ldquo;To delight in, or desire, things
beautiful, fine, honourable &mdash; and to have the power of getting them&ldquo;. But Sokrates remarks that honourable things are good things, and that every one without exception desires good. No
one desires evil except when he mistakes it for good. On this point all men are alike; the distinctive feature of virtue must then consist in the second half of the definition &mdash; in the power of
acquiring good things, such as health, wealth, money, power, dignities, &amp;c.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_14" href="#Footnotev2_22_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> But the acquisition of these things is
not virtuous, unless it be made consistently with justice and moderation: moreover the man who acts justly is virtuous, even though he does not acquire them. It appears then that every agent who acts
with justice <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page237" id="v2page237"></a>237</span>and moderation is virtuous. But this is nugatory as a definition of virtue: for justice and moderation are only
known as parts of virtue, and require to be themselves defined. No man can know what a part of virtue is, unless he knows what virtue itself is.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_15" href=
"#Footnotev2_22_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Menon must look for a better definition, including nothing but what is already known or admitted.</p>

<p><i>Menon.</i> &mdash; Your conversation, Sokrates, produces the effect of the shock of the torpedo: you stun and confound me: you throw me into inextricable perplexity, so that I can make no
answer. I have often discoursed copiously &mdash; and, as I thought, effectively &mdash; upon virtue; but now you have shown that I do not even know what virtue is. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If I throw
you into perplexity, it is only because I am myself in the like perplexity and ignorance. I do not know what virtue is, any more than you: and I shall be glad to continue the search for finding it,
if you will assist me.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_9" id="Sidenotev2_22_9"></a> But how is the process of search available to any purpose? No man searches for what he already knows: and for what he
does not know, it is useless to search, for he cannot tell when he has found it.</span></p>

<p><i>Menon.</i> &mdash; But how are you to search for that of which you are altogether ignorant? Even if you do find it, how can you ever know that you have found it? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You are
now introducing a troublesome doctrine, laid down by those who are averse to the labour of thought. They tell us that a man cannot search either for what he knows, or for what he does not know. For
the former, research is superfluous: for the latter it is unprofitable and purposeless, since the searcher does not know what he is looking for.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_10" id="Sidenotev2_22_10"></a> Theory of reminiscence propounded by Sokrates &mdash; anterior immortality of the soul &mdash; what is called teaching
is the revival and recognition of knowledge acquired in a former life, but forgotten.</span></p>

<p>I do not believe this doctrine (continues Sokrates). Priests, priestesses, and poets (Pindar among them) tell us, that the mind of man is immortal and has existed throughout all past time, in
conjunction with successive bodies; alternately abandoning one body, or dying &mdash; and taking up new life or reviving in another body. In this perpetual succession of existences, it has seen every
thing, &mdash; both here and in Hades and everywhere else &mdash; and has learnt every thing. But though thus omniscient, it has forgotten the larger portion of its knowledge. Yet what has <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page238" id="v2page238"></a>238</span>been thus forgotten may again be revived. What we call learning, is such revival. It is reminiscence of something which the mind had
seen in a former state of existence, and knew, but had forgotten. Since then all the parts of nature are analogous, or cognate &mdash; and since the mind has gone through and learnt them all &mdash;
we cannot wonder that the revival of any one part should put it upon the track of recovering for itself all the rest, both about virtue and about every thing else, if a man will only persevere in
intent meditation. All research and all learning is thus nothing but reminiscence. In our researches, we are not looking for what we do not know: we are looking for what we do know, but have
forgotten. There is therefore ample motive, and ample remuneration, for prosecuting enquiries: and your doctrine which pronounces them to be unprofitable, is incorrect.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_16"

<p>Sokrates proceeds to illustrate the position, just laid down, by cross-examining Menon&rsquo;s youthful slave, who, though wholly untaught and having never heard any mention of geometry, is
brought by a proper series of questions to give answers out of his own mind, furnishing the solution of a geometrical problem. The first part of the examination brings him to a perception of the
difficulty, and makes him feel a painful perplexity, from which he desires to obtain relief:<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_17" href="#Footnotev2_22_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> the second part guides
his mind in the efforts necessary for fishing up a solution out of its own pre-existing, but forgotten, stores. True opinions, which he had long had within him without knowing it, are awakened by
interrogation, and become cognitions. From the fact that the mind thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page239" id="v2page239"></a>239</span>possesses the truth of things which it has not acquired
in this life, Sokrates infers that it must have gone through a pre-existence of indefinite duration, or must be immortal.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_18" href="#Footnotev2_22_18"><span class=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_12" id="Sidenotev2_22_12"></a> Enquiry taken up &mdash; Whether virtue is teachable? without determining what virtue is.</span></p>

<p>The former topic of enquiry is now resumed: but at the instance of Menon, the question taken up, is not &mdash; &ldquo;What is virtue?&rdquo; but &mdash; &ldquo;Is virtue teachable or not?&rdquo;
Sokrates, after renewing his objection against the inversion of philosophical order by discussing the second question without having determined the first, enters upon the discussion hypothetically,
assuming as a postulate, that nothing can be taught except knowledge. The question then stands thus &mdash; &ldquo;Is virtue knowledge?&ldquo; If it be, it can be taught: if not, it cannot be
taught.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_19" href="#Footnotev2_22_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a></p>

the guidance of knowledge.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates proceeds to prove that virtue is knowledge, or a mode of knowledge. Virtue is good: all good things are profitable. But none of the things accounted good are profitable, unless they be
rightly employed; that is, employed with knowledge or intelligence. This is true not only of health, wealth, beauty, strength, power, &amp;c., but also of the mental attributes justice, moderation,
courage, quick apprehension, &amp;c. All of these are profitable, and therefore good, if brought into action under knowledge or right intelligence; none of them are profitable or good, without this
condition &mdash; which is therefore the distinctive constituent of virtue.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_20" href="#Footnotev2_22_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

<p>Virtue, therefore, being knowledge or a mode of knowledge, cannot come by nature, but must be teachable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_14" id="Sidenotev2_22_14"></a> Virtue, as being knowledge, must be teachable. Yet there are opposing reasons, showing that it cannot be teachable. No
teachers of it can be found.</span></p>

<p>Yet again there are other contrary reasons (he proceeds) which prove that it cannot be teachable. For if it were so, there would be distinct and assignable teachers and learners of it, and the
times and places could be pointed out where it is taught and learnt. We see that this is the case with all arts and professions. But in regard to virtue, there are neither recognised teachers, nor
learners, nor years of learning. The Sophists pretend to be teachers of it, but are not:<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_21" href="#Footnotev2_22_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a

teach virtue.</span></p>

<p>Here, a new speaker is introduced into the dialogue &mdash; Anytus, one of the accusers of Sokrates before the Dikastery. The conversation is carried on for some time between Sokrates and him.
Anytus denies altogether that the Sophists are teachers of virtue, and even denounces them with bitter contempt and wrath. But he maintains that the leading and esteemed citizens of the state do
really teach it. Anytus however presently breaks off in a tone of displeasure and menace towards Sokrates himself.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_23" href="#Footnotev2_22_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
The conversation is then renewed with Menon, and it is shown that the leading politicians cannot be considered as teachers of virtue, any more than the Sophists. There exist no teachers of it; and
therefore we must conclude that it is not teachable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_16" id="Sidenotev2_22_16"></a> Confused state of the discussion. No way of acquiring virtue is shown.</span></p>

<p>The state of the discussion as it stands now, is represented by two hypothetical syllogisms, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1. If virtue is knowledge, it is teachable:<br>
But virtue is knowledge:<br>
Therefore virtue is teachable.<br>
<p class="noind">2. If virtue is knowledge, it is teachable:<br>
But virtue is not teachable:<br>
Therefore virtue is not knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noind">The premisses of each of these two syllogisms contradict the conclusion of the other. Both cannot be true. If virtue is not acquired by teaching and does not come by nature, how are
there any virtuous men?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_17" id="Sidenotev2_22_17"></a> Sokrates modifies his premisses &mdash; knowledge is not the only thing which guides to good results &mdash; right
opinion will do the same.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates continues his argument: The second premiss of the first syllogism &mdash; that virtue is knowledge &mdash; is true, but not the whole truth. In proving it we assumed that <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page241" id="v2page241"></a>241</span>there was nothing except knowledge which guided us to useful and profitable consequences. But this assumption will not hold. There is
something else besides knowledge, which also guides us to the same useful results. That something is <i>right opinion</i>, which is quite different from knowledge. The man who holds right opinions is
just as profitable to us, and guides us quite as well to right actions, as if he knew. Right opinions, so long as they stay in the mind, are as good as knowledge, for the purpose of guidance in
practice. But the difference is, that they are evanescent and will not stay in the mind: while knowledge is permanent and ineffaceable. They are exalted into knowledge, when bound in the mind by a
chain of causal reasoning:<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_24" href="#Footnotev2_22_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> that is, by the process of reminiscence, before described.</p>

<p>And thus (concludes Sokrates) the answer to the question originally started by Menon &mdash; &ldquo;Whether virtue is teachable?&ldquo; &mdash; is as follows. Virtue in its highest sense, in which
it is equivalent to or coincident with knowledge, is teachable: but no such virtue exists. That which exists in the most distinguished citizens under the name of virtue, &mdash; or at least producing
the results of virtue in practice &mdash; is not teachable. Nor does it come by nature, but by special inspiration from the Gods. The best statesmen now existing cannot make any other person like
themselves: if any one of them could do this, he would be, in comparison with the rest, like a real thing compared with a shadow.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_28" href="#Footnotev2_22_28"><span class=

<p>This last observation is repeated by Sokrates at the end &mdash; as it had been stated at the beginning, and in more than one place during the continuance &mdash; of the dialogue. In fact,
Sokrates seems at first resolved to enforce the natural and necessary priority of the latter question: but is induced by the solicitation of Menon to invert the order.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_30" href=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_22" id="Sidenotev2_22_22"></a> Mischief of debating ulterior and secondary questions when the fundamental notions and word are unsettled.</span></p>

<p>The propriety of the order marked out, but not pursued, by Sokrates is indisputable. Before you can enquire how virtue is generated or communicated, you must be satisfied that you know what virtue
is. You must know the essence of the subject &mdash; or those predicates which the word connotes ( = the meaning of the term) before you investigate its accidents and antecedents.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_22_31" href="#Footnotev2_22_31"><span class="sp">31</span></a> Menon begins by being satisfied that he knows what <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page243" id="v2page243">
</a>243</span>virtue is: so satisfied, that he accounts it discreditable for a man not to know: although he is made to answer like one who has never thought upon the subject, and does not even
understand the question. Sokrates, on the other hand, not only confesses that he does not himself know, but asserts that he never yet met with a man who did know. One of the most important lessons in
this, as in so many other Platonic dialogues, is the mischief of proceeding to debate ulterior and secondary questions, without having settled the fundamental words and notions: the false persuasion
of knowledge, common to almost every one, respecting these familiar ethical and social ideas. Menon represents the common state of mind. He begins with the false persuasion that he as well as every
one else knows what virtue is: and even when he is proved to be ignorant, he still feels no interest in the fundamental enquiry, but turns aside to his original object of curiosity &mdash;
&ldquo;Whether virtue is teachable&ldquo;. Nothing can be more repugnant to an ordinary mind than the thorough sifting of deep-seated, long familiarised, notions &mdash; &tau;&#8056;

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_23" id="Sidenotev2_22_23"></a> Doctrine of Sokrates in the Menon &mdash; desire of good alleged to be universally felt &mdash; in what sense this is
true.</span></p>

<p>The confession of Sokrates that neither he nor any other person in his experience knows what virtue is &mdash; that it must be made a subject of special and deliberate investigation &mdash; and
that no man can know what justice, or any other part of virtue is, unless he first knows what virtue as a whole is<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_32" href="#Footnotev2_22_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a>
&mdash; are matters to be kept in mind also, as contrasting with other portions of the Platonic dialogues, wherein virtue, justice, &amp;c., are tacitly assumed (according to the received habit) as
matters known and understood. The contributions which we obtain from the Menon towards finding out the Platonic notion of virtue, are negative rather than positive. The comments of Sokrates upon
Menon&rsquo;s first definition include the doctrine often announced in Plato &mdash; That no man by nature desires suffering or evil; every man desires good: if <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page244" id="v2page244"></a>244</span>he seeks or pursues suffering or evil, he does so merely from error or ignorance, mistaking it for good.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_33" href=
"#Footnotev2_22_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> This is true, undoubtedly, if we mean what is good or evil for himself: and if by good or evil we mean (according to the doctrine enforced by
Sokrates in the Protagoras) the result of items of pleasure and pain, rightly estimated and compared by the Measuring Reason. Every man naturally desires pleasure, and the means of acquiring
pleasure, for himself: every man naturally shrinks from pain, or the causes of pain, to himself: every one compares and measures the items of each with more or less wisdom and impartiality. But the
proposition is not true, if we mean what is good or evil for others: and if by good we mean (as Sokrates is made to declare in the Gorgias) something apart from pleasure, and by evil something apart
from pain (understanding pleasure and pain in their largest sense). A man sometimes desires what is good for others, sometimes what is evil for others, as the case may be. Plato&rsquo;s observation
therefore cannot be admitted &mdash; That as to the wish or desire, all men are alike: one man is no better than another.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_34" href="#Footnotev2_22_34"><span class=

<p>The second portion of Plato&rsquo;s theory, advanced to explain what virtue is, presents nothing more satisfactory. Virtue is useful or profitable: but neither health, strength, beauty, wealth,
power, &amp;c., are profitable, unless rightly used: nor are justice, moderation, courage, quick apprehension, good memory, &amp;c., profitable, unless they are accompanied and guided by knowledge or
prudence.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_35" href="#Footnotev2_22_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> Now if by <i>profitable</i> we have reference not to the individual agent alone, but to other persons
concerned also, the proposition is true, but not instructive or distinct. For what is meant by <i>right use</i>? To what ends are the gifts here enumerated to be turned, in order to constitute right
use? What again is meant by <i>knowledge</i>? knowledge of what?<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_36" href="#Footnotev2_22_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> This is a question put by Sokrates in many other
dialogues, and necessary to be put here also. Moreover, knowledge is a term which requires to be determined, not merely to some assignable object, but also in its general import, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page245" id="v2page245"></a>245</span>no less than virtue. We shall come presently to an elaborate dialogue (The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus) in which Plato makes many attempts to
determine knowledge generally, but ends in a confessed failure. Knowledge must be knowledge <i>possessed by some one</i>, and must be knowledge of <i>something</i>. What is it, that a man must know,
in order that his justice or courage may become profitable? Is it pleasures and pains, with their causes, and the comparative magnitude of each (as Sokrates declares in the Protagoras), in order that
he may contribute to diminish the sum of pains, increase that of pleasures, to himself or to the society? If this be what he is required to know, Plato should have said so &mdash; or if not, what
else &mdash; in order that the requirement of knowledge might be made an intelligible condition.</p>

question and get rid of it.</span></p>

<p>Though the subject of direct debate in the Menon is the same as that in the Protagoras (whether virtue be teachable?) yet the manner of treating this subject is very different in the two. One
point of difference between the two has been just noticed. Another difference is, that whereas in Menon the teachability of virtue is assumed to be disproved, because there are no recognised teachers
or learners of it &mdash; in the Protagoras this argument is produced by Sokrates, but is combated at length (as we shall presently see) by a counter-argument on the part of the Sophists, without any
rejoinder from Sokrates. Of this counter-argument no notice is taken in the Menon: although, if it be well-founded, it would have served Anytus no less than Protagoras, as a solution of the
difficulties raised by Sokrates. Such diversity of handling and argumentative fertility, are characteristic of the Platonic procedure. I have already remarked, that the establishment of positive
conclusions, capable of being severed from their premisses, registered in the memory, and used as principles for deduction &mdash; is foreign to the spirit of these Dialogues of Search. To settle a
question and finish with it &mdash; to get rid of the debate, as if it were a troublesome temporary necessity &mdash; is not what Plato desires. His purpose is, to provoke the spirit of enquiry
&mdash; to stimulate responsive efforts of the mind by a painful shock of exposed ignorance &mdash; and to open before it a multiplicity of new roads with varied points of view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page246" id="v2page246"></a>246</span><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_26" id="Sidenotev2_22_26"></a> Anxiety of Plato to keep up and enforce the
spirit of research.</span></p>

<p>Nowhere in the Platonic writings is this provocative shock more vividly illustrated than in the Menon, by the simile of the electrical fish: a simile as striking as that of the magnet in Ion.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_22_37" href="#Footnotev2_22_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> Nowhere, again, is the true character of the Sokratic intellect more clearly enunciated. &ldquo;You complain, Menon,
that I plunge your mind into nothing but doubt, and puzzle, and conscious ignorance. If I do this, it is only because my own mind is already in that same condition.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_38" href=
"#Footnotev2_22_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> The only way out of it is, through joint dialectical colloquy and search; in which I invite you to accompany me, though I do not know when or where
it will end.&rdquo; And then, for the purpose of justifying as well as encouraging such prolonged search, Sokrates proceeds to unfold his remarkable hypothesis &mdash; eternal pre-existence,
boundless past experience, and omniscience, of the mind &mdash; identity of cognition with recognition, dependent on reminiscence. &ldquo;Research or enquiry (said some) is fruitless. You must search
either for that which you know, or for that which you do not know. The first is superfluous &mdash; the second impossible: for if you do not know what a thing is, how are you to be satisfied that the
answer which you find is that which you are looking for? How can you distinguish a true solution from another which is untrue, but plausible?&rdquo;</p>

of truth? Wherein consists the process called verification and proof, of that which is first presented as an hypothesis? This was one of the great problems debated between the Academics, the Stoics,

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_22_39" id="Footnotev2_22_39"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_22_39">39</a></span> Sokrates here calls this problem an
&#7952;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8056;&sigmaf; &lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;. Stallbaum (in his Prolegom. to the Menon, p. 14) describes it as a &ldquo;qu&aelig;stiunculam, haud
dubie e sophistarum disciplin&acirc; arreptam&rdquo;. If the Sophists were the first to raise this question, I think that by doing so they rendered service to the interests of philosophy. The
question is among the first which ought to be thoroughly debated and sifted, if we are to have a body of &ldquo;reasoned truth&ldquo; called philosophy.</p>

<p>I dissent from the opinion of Stallbaum (p. 20), though it is adopted both by Socher (Ueber Platon, p. 185) and by Steinhart (Einleitung zum Menon, p. 123), that the Menon was composed by Plato
during the lifetime of Sokrates. Schleiermacher (Einleitung zum Gorgias, p. 22; Einleitung zum Menon, pp. 329-330), Ueberweg (Aechth. Plat. Schr. p. 226), and K. F. Hermann, on the other hand, regard
the Menon as composed after the death of Sokrates, and on this point I agree with them, though whether it was composed not long after that event (as K. F. Hermann thinks) or thirteen years after it
(as Schleiermacher thinks), I see no sufficient grounds for deciding. I incline to the belief that its composition is considerably later than Hermann supposes; the mention of the Theban Ismenias is
one among the reasons rendering such later origin probable. Plato probably borrowed from the Xenophontic Anabasis the name, country, and social position of Menon, who may have received teaching from
Gorgias, as we know that Proxenus did, Xen. Anab. ii. 6, 16. The reader can compare the Einleitung of Schleiermacher (in which he professes to prove that the Menon is a corollary to the
The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus and Gorgias, and an immediate antecedent to the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, &mdash; that it solves the riddle of the Protagoras &mdash; and that it presupposes and refers back to the
Ph&aelig;drus) with the Einleitung of Steinhart (p. 120 seq.), who contests all these propositions, saying that the Menon is decidedly later than the Euthyd&ecirc;mus, and decidedly earlier than the
The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, Gorgias, and Ph&aelig;drus; with the opinions of Stallbaum and Hermann, who recognise an order different from that either of Steinhart or Schleiermacher; and with that of Ast,
who rejects the Menon altogether as unworthy of Plato. Every one of these dissentient critics has <i>something</i> to say for his opinion, while none of them (in my judgment) can make out anything
like a conclusive case. The mistake consists in assuming that there must have been a peremptory order and intentional interdependence among the Platonic Dialogues, and next in trying to show by
internal evidence what that order was.</p>

the answer here made by Plato &mdash; that verification consists in appeal to pre-natal experience.</span></p>

<p>Not one of these schools was satisfied with the very peculiar answer which the Platonic Sokrates here gives to the question. When truth is presented to us (he intimates), we recognise it as an old
friend after a long absence. We know it by reason of its conformity to our antecedent, pre-natal, experience (in the Ph&aelig;don, such pre-natal experience is restricted to commerce with the
substantial, intelligible, Ideas, which are not mentioned in the Menon): the soul or mind is immortal, has gone through an indefinite succession of temporary lives prior to the present, and will go
through an indefinite succession of temporary lives posterior to the present &mdash; &ldquo;long&aelig;, canitis si cognita, vit&aelig; Mors media est&ldquo;. The mind has thus become omniscient,
having seen, heard, and learnt every thing, both on earth and in Hades: but such knowledge exists as a confused and unavailable mass, having been buried and forgotten on the commencement of its
actual life.</p>

<p>Since all nature is in universal kindred, communion, or interdependence, that which we hear or see here, recalls to the memory, by association, portions of our prior forgotten omniscience.<span

with one continuous cosmical soul penetrating everywhere, will be found set forth in the kosmology of the Tim&aelig;us, pp. 37-42-43. It was held, with various modifications, both by the Pythagoreans
and the Stoics. Compare Cicero, Divinat. ii. 14-15; Virgil, &AElig;neid vi. 715 seqq.; Georgic. iv. 220; Sextus Empir. adv. Mathem. ix. 127; Ekphantus Pythagoreus ap. Stob&aelig;um, Tit. 48, vol. ii.
p. 320, Gaisford.</p>

<p>The view here taken by Plato, that all nature is cognate and interdependent &mdash; &#7941;&tau;&epsilon; &gamma;&#8048;&rho; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &phi;&#973;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;
&#7937;&pi;&#940;&sigma;&eta;&sigmaf; &sigma;&upsilon;&gamma;&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf; &omicron;&#8020;&sigma;&eta;&sigmaf; &mdash; is very similar to the theory of
Leibnitz:&mdash; &ldquo;Ubique per materiam disseminata statuo principia vitalia seu percipientia. Omnia in natur&acirc; sunt analogica&rdquo; (Leibnitz, Epist. ad Wagnerum, p. 466; Leibn. Opp.
Erdmann). Farther, that the human mind by virtue of its interdependence or kindred with all nature, includes a confused omniscience, is also a Leibnitzian view. &ldquo;Car comme tout est plein (ce
qui rend toute la mati&egrave;re li&eacute;e) et comme dans le plein tout mouvement fait quelqu&rsquo; effet sur les corps distans &agrave; mesure de la distance, de sorte que chaque corps est
affect&eacute; non seulement par ceux qui le touchent, et se ressent en quelque fa&ccedil;on de tout ce qui leur arrive &mdash; mais aussi par leur moyen se ressent de ceux qui touchent les premiers
dont il est touch&eacute; imm&eacute;diatement. Il s&rsquo;ensuit que cette communication va &agrave; quelque distance que ce soit. Et par consequent tout corps se ressent de tout ce qui se fait dans
l&rsquo;Univers: tellement que celui, qui voit tout, pourroit lire dans chacun ce qui se fait partout et m&ecirc;me ce qui s&rsquo;est fait et se fera, en remarquant dans le pr&eacute;sent ce qui est
&eacute;loign&eacute; tant selon les temps que selon les lieux: &sigma;&#973;&mu;&pi;&nu;&omicron;&iota;&alpha; &pi;&#940;&nu;&tau;&alpha;, disoit Hippocrate. Mais une &acirc;me ne peut lire en elle
m&ecirc;me que ce qui y est represent&eacute; distinctement: elle ne sauroit developper tout d&rsquo;un coup ses r&egrave;gles, car elles vont &agrave; l&rsquo;infini. Ainsi quoique chaque monade
cr&eacute;&eacute;e repr&eacute;sente tout l&rsquo;Univers, elle repr&eacute;sente plus distinctement le corps qui lui est particuli&egrave;rement affect&eacute;, et dont elle fait
l&rsquo;Ent&eacute;l&eacute;chie. Et comme ce corps exprime tout l&rsquo;Univers par la connexion de toute la mati&egrave;re dans le plein, l&rsquo;&acirc;me repr&eacute;sente aussi tout l&rsquo;Univers en
repr&eacute;sentant ce corps qui lui appartient d&rsquo;une mani&egrave;re particuli&egrave;re&rdquo; (Leibnitz, Monadologie, sect. 61-62, No. 88, p. 710; Opp. Leibn. ed. Erdmann).</p>

<p>Again, Leibnitz, in another Dissertation: &ldquo;Comme &agrave; cause de la pl&eacute;nitude du monde tout est li&eacute;, et chaque corps agit sur chaque autre corps, plus ou moins, selon la
distance, et en est affect&eacute; par la r&eacute;action &mdash; il s&rsquo;ensuit que chaque monade est un miroir vivant, ou dou&eacute; d&rsquo;action interne, repr&eacute;sentatif de
l&rsquo;Univers, suivant son point de vue, et aussi r&eacute;gl&eacute; que l&rsquo;Univers m&ecirc;me&rdquo; (Principes de la Nature et de la Grace, p. 714, ed. Erdmann; also Syst&egrave;me Nouveau,
p. 128, a. 36).</p>

<p>Leibnitz expresses more than once how much his own metaphysical views agreed with those of Plato. Lettre &agrave; M. Bourguet, pp. 723-725. He expresses his belief in the pre-existence of the
soul: &ldquo;Tout ce que je crois pouvoir assurer, est, que l&rsquo;&acirc;me de tout animal a pr&eacute;exist&eacute;, et a &eacute;t&eacute; dans un corps organique: qui enfin, par beaucoup de
changemens, involutions, et &eacute;volutions, est devenu l&rsquo;animal pr&eacute;sent&rdquo; (Lettre &agrave; M. Bourguet, p. 731). And in the Platonic doctrine of reminiscence to a certain point:
&ldquo;II y a quelque chose de solide dans ce que dit Platon de la r&eacute;miniscence&rdquo; (p. 137, b. 10). Also Leibnitz&rsquo;s Nouveaux Essais sur l&rsquo;Entendement Humain, p. 196, b. 28; and
Epistol. ad Hanschium, p. 446, a. 12.</p>

Ph&aelig;don.</span></p>

<p>In various other dialogues of Plato, the same hypothesis is found repeated. His conception of the immortality of the soul or mind, includes pre-existence as well as post-existence: a perpetual
succession of temporary lives, each in a distinct body, each terminated by death, and each followed by renewed life for a time in another body. In fact, the pre-existence of the mind formed the most
important part of Plato&rsquo;s theory about immortality: for he employed it as the means of explaining how the mind became possessed of general notions. As the doctrine is stated in the Menon, it is
made applicable to all minds (instead of being confined, as in Ph&aelig;drus, Ph&aelig;don, and elsewhere, to a few highly gifted minds, and to commerce with the intelligible substances called
Ideas). This appears from the person chosen to illustrate the alleged possibility of stimulating artificial reminiscence: that person is an unlettered youth, taken at hazard from among the numerous
slaves of Menon.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_42" href="#Footnotev2_22_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a></p>

<p>It is true, indeed (as Schleiermacher observes), that the questions put by Sokrates to this youth are in great proportion leading questions, suggesting their own answers. They would not have
served their purpose unless they had been such. The illustration here furnished, of the Sokratic interrogatory process, is highly interesting, and his theory is in a great degree true.<a name=

through a large course; which has disappeared from his memory, yet not irrevocably. Portions of it may be revived, if new matter be presented to the mind, fitted to excite the recollection of them by
the laws of association. By suitable interrogations, a teacher may thus recall to the memory of his pupils many facts and judgments which have been hitherto forgotten: he may bring into juxtaposition
those which have never before been put together in the mind: and he may thus make them elicit instructive comparisons and inferences. He may provoke the pupils to strike out new results for
themselves, or to follow, by means of their own stock of knowledge, in the path suggested by the questions. He may farther lead them to perceive the fallacy of erroneous analogies which at first
presented themselves as plausible; and to become painfully sensible of embarrassment and perplexing ignorance, before he puts those questions which indicate the way of escape from it. Upon the
necessity of producing such painful consciousness of ignorance Plato insists emphatically, as is his custom.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_44" href="#Footnotev2_22_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

<p class="noind">and in Wordsworth &mdash; &ldquo;Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the other hand Aristotle alludes also to the same doctrine and criticises it; but he does not seem (so far as I can understand this brief allusion) to seize exactly Plato&rsquo;s meaning. This
is the remark of the Scholiast on Aristotle: and I think it just. It is curious to compare the way in which &#7936;&nu;&#940;&mu;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; is handled by Plato in the Menon and
Ph&aelig;don, and by Aristotle in the valuable little tract &mdash; &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &mu;&nu;&#942;&nu;&eta;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&#7936;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&nu;&#942;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf; (p. 451, b.). Aristotle has his own way of replying to the difficulty raised in the question of Menon, and tries to show that sometimes
we <i>know</i> in one sense and <i>do not know</i> in another. See Aristotel. Anal. Prior., ii. p. 67, a. 22; Anal. Poster. i. p. 71, a. 27; and the Scholia on the former passage, p. 193, b. 21, ed.
Brandis.</p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton, in one of the Appendixes to his edition of Reid&rsquo;s Works (Append. D. p. 890 seq.), has given a learned and valuable translation and illustration of the treatise of
Aristotle &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &#7944;&nu;&alpha;&mu;&nu;&#942;&sigma;&epsilon;&omega;&sigmaf;. I note, however, with some surprise, that while collecting many interesting comments from writers
who lived <i>after</i> Aristotle, he has not adverted to what was said upon this same subject by Plato, <i>before</i> Aristotle. It was the more to be expected that he would do this, since he insists
so emphatically upon the complete originality of Aristotle.</p>

priori</i> reasonings &mdash; Different from the modern doctrine.</span></p>

<p>Plato does not intend here to distinguish (as many modern writers distinguish) geometry from other sciences, as if geometry were known <i>&agrave; priori</i>, and other sciences known <i>&agrave;
posteriori</i> or from experience. He does not suppose that geometrical truths are such that no man can possibly believe the contrary of them; or that they are different in this respect from the
truths of any other science. He here maintains that all the sciences lie equally in the untaught mind,<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_45" href="#Footnotev2_22_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> but buried,
forgotten, and confused: so as to require the skill of the questioner not merely to recall them into consciousness, but to disentangle truth from error. Far from supposing that the untaught mind has
a natural tendency to answer correctly geometrical questions, he treats erroneous answers as springing up more naturally than true answers, and as requiring a process of painful exposure before the
mind can be put upon the right track. The questioner, without possessing any knowledge himself, (so Plato thinks,) can nevertheless exercise an influence at once stimulating, corrective, and
directive. He stimulates the action of the associative process, to call up facts, comparisons, and analogies, bearing on the question: he arrests the respondent on a wrong answer, creating within him
a painful sense of ignorance and embarrassment: he directs him by his subsequent questions into the path of right answers. His obstetric aid (to use the simile in Plato&rsquo;s The&aelig;tetus),
though presupposing the pregnancy of the respondent mind, is indispensable both to forward the childbirth, and to throw away any offspring which may happen to be deformed. In the The&aelig;tetus, the
main stress is laid on that part of the dialogue which is performed by the questioner: in the Menon, upon the latent competence and large dead stock of an untaught respondent.</p>

<p>The mind of the slave questioned by Sokrates is discovered to be pregnant. Though he has received no teaching from any professed geometer, he is nevertheless found competent, when subjected to a

of geometry. He knows nothing about geometry: nevertheless there exist in his mind true opinions respecting that which he does not know. These opinions are &ldquo;called up like a dream&rdquo; by the
interrogatories: which, if repeated and diversified, convert the opinions into knowledge, taken up by the respondent out of himself.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_46" href="#Footnotev2_22_46"><span class=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_32" id="Sidenotev2_22_32"></a> Plato&rsquo;s theory about pre-natal experience. He took no pains to ascertain and measure the extent of post-natal
experience.</span></p>

<p>It is thus that Plato applies to philosophical theory the doctrine (borrowed from the Pythagoreans) of pre-natal experience and cognitions: which he considers, not as inherent appurtenances of the
mind, but as acquisitions made by the mind during various antecedent lives. These ideas (Plato argues) cannot have been acquired during the present life, because the youth has received no special
teaching in geometry. But Plato here takes no account of the multiplicity and diversity of experiences gone through, comparisons made, and acquirements lodged, in the mind of a youthful adult however
unlettered. He recognises no acquisition of knowledge except through special teaching. So, too, in the Protagoras, we shall find him putting into the mouth of Sokrates the doctrine &mdash; That
virtue is not taught and cannot be taught, because there were no special masters or times of teaching. But in that dialogue we shall also see Plato furnishing an elaborate reply to this doctrine in
the speech of Protagoras; who indicates the multifarious and powerful influences which are perpetually operative, even without special professors, in creating and enforcing ethical sentiment. If
Plato had taken pains to study the early life of the untaught slave, with its stock of facts, judgments, comparisons, and inferences suggested by analogy, &amp;c., he might easily have found enough to
explain the competence of the slave to answer the questions appearing in the dialogue. And even if enough could not have been found, to afford a direct and specific explanation &mdash; <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page253" id="v2page253"></a>253</span>we must remember that only a very small proportion of the long series of mental phenomena realised in the infant, the child, the youth, ever
comes to be remembered or recorded. To assume that the large unknown remainder would be insufficient, if known, to afford the explanation sought, is neither philosophical nor reasonable. This is
assumed in every form of the doctrine of innate ideas: and assumed by Plato here without even trying any explanation to dispense with the hypothesis: simply because the youth interrogated had never
received any special instruction in geometry.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_33" id="Sidenotev2_22_33"></a> Little or nothing is said in the Menon about the Platonic Ideas or Forms.</span></p>

<p>I have already observed, that though great stress is laid in this dialogue upon the doctrine of opinions and knowledge inherited from an antecedent life &mdash; upon the distinction between true
opinion and knowledge &mdash; and upon the identity of the process of learning with reminiscence &mdash; yet nothing is said about universal Ideas or Forms, so much dwelt upon in other dialogues. In
the Ph&aelig;drus and Ph&aelig;don, it is with these universal Ideas that the mind is affirmed to have had communion during its prior existence, as contrasted with the particulars of sense
apprehended during the present life: while in the Menon, the difference pointed out between true opinions and knowledge is something much less marked and decisive. Both the one and the other are said
to be, not acquired during this life, but inherited from antecedent life: to be innate, yet unperceived &mdash; revived by way of reminiscence and interrogation. True opinions are affirmed to render
as much service as knowledge, in reference to practice. There is only this distinction between them &mdash; that true opinions are transient, and will not remain in the mind until they are bound in
it by causal reasoning, or become knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_34" id="Sidenotev2_22_34"></a> What Plato meant by Causal Reasoning &mdash; his distinction between knowledge and right opinion.</span></p>

<p>What Plato meant by this &ldquo;causal reasoning, or computation of cause,&rdquo; is not clearly explained. But he affirms very unequivocally, first, that the distinction between true opinion and
knowledge is one of the few things of which he feels assured<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_47" href="#Footnotev2_22_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> &mdash; next, with somewhat less confidence, that the
distinction consists only in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page254" id="v2page254"></a>254</span>the greater security which knowledge affords for permanent in-dwelling in the mind. This appears
substantially the same distinction as what is laid down in other words towards the close of the dialogue &mdash; That those, who have only true opinions and not knowledge, judge rightly without
knowing how or why; by an aptitude not their own but supplied to them from without for the occasion, in the nature of inspiration or prophetic <i>&oelig;strus</i>. Hence they are unable to teach
others, or to transfer this occasional inspiration to any one else. They cannot give account of what they affect to know, nor answer scrutinizing questions to test it. This power of answering and
administering cross-examination, is Plato&rsquo;s characteristic test of real knowledge &mdash; as I have already observed in my eighth chapter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_35" id="Sidenotev2_22_35"></a> This distinction compared with modern philosophical views.</span></p>

<p>To translate the views of Plato into analogous views of a modern philosopher, we may say &mdash; That right opinion, as contrasted with knowledge, is a discriminating and acute empirical judgment:
inferring only from old particulars to new particulars (without the intermediate help and guarantee of general propositions distinctly enunciated and interpreted), but selecting for every new case
the appropriate analogies out of the past, with which it ought to be compared. Many persons judge in this manner fairly well, and some with extreme success. But let them be ever so successful in
practice, they proceed without any conscious method; they are unable to communicate the grounds of their inferences to others: and when they are right, it is only by haphazard &mdash; that is (to use
Plato&rsquo;s language), through special inspiration vouchsafed to them by the Gods. But when they ascend to knowledge, and come to judge scientifically, they then distribute these particular facts
into classes &mdash; note the constant sequences as distinguished from the occasional &mdash; and draw their inferences in every new case according to such general laws or uniformities of antecedent
and consequent. Such uniform and unconditional antecedents are the only causes of which we have cognizance. They admit of being described in the language which Plato here uses
(&alpha;&#7984;&tau;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf; &lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&sigma;&mu;&#8183;), and they also serve as reasons for justifying or explaining our inferences to others.<a name=

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_22_48" id="Footnotev2_22_48"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_22_48">48</a></span> We have seen that in the Menon Plato denies all
&delta;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&chi;&#942;, and recognises nothing but &#7936;&nu;&#940;&mu;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;. The doctrine of the Tim&aelig;us (p. 51 D-E) is very different. He there lays
especial stress on the distinction between &delta;&iota;&delta;&alpha;&chi;&#8052; and &pi;&epsilon;&iota;&theta;&#974; &mdash; the first belonging to &#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta;,
the second to &delta;&#972;&xi;&alpha;. Also in Gorgias, 454, and in Republic, v. pp. 477-479, about &delta;&#972;&xi;&alpha; and &#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta;. In those dialogues the
distinction between the two is presented as marked and fundamental, as if &delta;&#972;&xi;&alpha; alone was fallible and &#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta; infallible. In the Menon the
distinction appears as important, but not fundamental; the Platonic Ideas or Universals being <i>not</i> recognised as constituting a substantive world by themselves. In this respect the Menon is
nearer to the truth in describing the difference between &#8000;&rho;&theta;&#8052; &delta;&#972;&xi;&alpha; and &#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta;. Mr. John Stuart Mill (in the chapter of
his System of Logic wherein the true theory of the Syllogism is for the first time expounded) has clearly explained what that difference amounts to. All our inferences are <i>from</i> particulars,
sometimes <i>to</i> new particulars directly and at once (&delta;&#972;&xi;&alpha;), sometimes <i>to</i> generals in the first instance, and through them <i>to</i> new particulars; which latter, or
scientific process, is highly valuable as a security for correctness (&#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta;). &ldquo;Not only&ldquo; (says Mr. Mill) &ldquo;<i>may</i> we reason from
particulars to particulars without passing through generals, but we perpetually <i>do</i> so reason. All our earliest inferences are of this nature. From the first dawn of intelligence we draw
inferences, but years elapse before we learn the use of general language. We are constantly reasoning from ourselves to other people, or from one person to another, without giving ourselves the
trouble to erect our observations into general maxims of human or external nature. If we have an extensive experience and retain its impressions strongly, we may acquire in this manner a very
considerable power of accurate judgment, which we may be utterly incapable of justifying or of communicating to others. Among the higher order of practical intellects, there have been many of whom it
was remarked how admirably they suited their means to their ends, without being able to give any sufficient account of what they did; and applied, or seemed to apply, recondite principles which they
were wholly unable to state. This is a natural consequence of having a mind stored with appropriate particulars, and having been accustomed to reason at once from these to fresh particulars, without
practising the habit of stating to one&rsquo;s self or others the corresponding general propositions. The cases of men of talent performing wonderful things they know not how, are examples of the
rudest and most spontaneous forms of the operations of superior minds. It is a defect in them, and often a source of errors, not to have generalised as they went on; but generalisation, though a
help, the most important indeed of all helps, is not an essential&rdquo; (Mill, Syst. of Logic, Book II. ch. iii.). Compare the first chapter of the Metaphysica of Aristotle, p. 980, a. 15, b. 7.</p>

antipathy to the Sophists and to philosophy generally.</span></p>

<p>The manner in which Anytus, the accuser of Sokrates before the Dikastery, is introduced into this dialogue, deserves notice. The questions are put to him by Sokrates &mdash; &ldquo;Is virtue
teachable? How is Menon to learn virtue, and from whom? Ought he not to do as he would do if he wished to learn medicine or music: to put himself under some paid professional man as teacher?&rdquo;
Anytus answers these questions in the affirmative: but asks, where such professional teachers of virtue are to be found. &ldquo;There are the Sophists,&rdquo; replies Sokrates. Upon this Anytus
breaks out into a burst of angry invective against the Sophists; denouncing them as corruptors of youth, whom none but a madman would consult, and who ought to be banished by public authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page256" id="v2page256"></a>256</span>Why are you so bitter against the Sophists? asks Sokrates. Have any of them ever injured you? <i>Anyt.</i> &mdash; No; never:
I have never been in the company of any one of them, nor would I ever suffer any of my family to be so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then you have no experience whatever about the Sophists? <i>Anyt.</i>
&mdash; None: and I hope that I never may have. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; How then can you know about this matter, how far it is good or bad, if you have no experience whatever about it? <i>Anyt.</i>
&mdash; Easily. I know what sort of men the Sophists are, whether I have experience of them or not. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Perhaps you are a prophet, Anytus: for how else you can know about them, I do
not understand, even on your own statement.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_49" href="#Footnotev2_22_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>Anytus then declares, that the persons from whom Menon ought to learn virtue are the leading practical politicians; and that any one of them can teach it. But Sokrates puts a series of questions,
showing that the leading Athenian politicians, Themistokl&ecirc;s, Perikl&ecirc;s, &amp;c., have not been able to teach virtue even to their own sons: <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, therefore, they cannot
teach it to any one else. Anytus treats this series of questions as disparaging and calumnious towards the great men of Athens. He breaks off the conversation abruptly, with an angry warning to
Sokrates to be cautious about his language, and to take care of his own safety.</p>

<p>The dialogue is then prosecuted and finished between Sokrates and Menon: and at the close of it, Sokrates says &mdash; &ldquo;Talk to Anytus, and communicate to him that persuasion which you have
yourself contracted,<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_50" href="#Footnotev2_22_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> in order that he may be more mildly disposed: for, if you persuade him, you will do some good to
the Athenians as well as to himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The enemy and accuser of Sokrates is here depicted as the bitter enemy of the Sophists also. And Plato takes pains to exhibit the enmity of Anytus to the Sophists as founded on no facts or
experience. Without having seen or ascertained anything about them, Anytus hates them as violently as if he had sustained from them some personal injury; a sentiment which many <span class="pagenum">
<a name="v2page257" id="v2page257"></a>257</span>Platonic critics and many historians of philosophy have inherited from him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_22_51" href="#Footnotev2_22_51"><span class=
"sp">51</span></a> Whether the corruption which these Sophists were accused of bringing about in the minds of youth, was intentional or not intentional on their part &mdash; how such corruption could
have been perpetually continued, while at the same time the eminent Sophists enjoyed long and unabated esteem from the youth themselves and from their relatives &mdash; are difficulties which Anytus
does not attempt to explain, though they are started here by Sokrates. Indeed we find the same topics employed by Sokrates himself, in his defence before the Dikasts against the same charge.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_22_52" href="#Footnotev2_22_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> Anytus has confidence in no one except the practical statesmen: and when a question is raised about <i>their</i> power to
impart their own excellence to others, he presently takes offence against Sokrates also. The same causes which have determined his furious antipathy against the Sophists, make him ready to transfer
the like antipathy to Sokrates. He is a man of plain sense, practical habits, and conservative patriotism &mdash; who worships what he finds accredited as virtue, and dislikes the talkers and
theorisers about virtue in general: whether they debated in subtle interrogation and dialectics, like Sokrates &mdash; or lectured in eloquent continuous discourse, like Protagoras. He accuses the
Sophists, in this dialogue, of corrupting the youth; just as he and Mel&ecirc;tus, before the Dikastery, accused Sokrates of the same offence. He understands the use of words, to discuss actual
business before the assembly or dikastery; but he hates discourse on the generalities of ethics or philosophy. He is essentially &mu;&iota;&sigma;&#972;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;. The
point which he condemns in the Sophists, is that which they have in common with Sokrates.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_22_51" id="Footnotev2_22_51"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_22_51">51</a></span> Upon the bitter antipathy here expressed by Anytus against the
Sophists, whom nevertheless he admits that he does not at all know, Steinhart remarks as follows:&mdash; &ldquo;Gerade so haben zu allen Zeiten Orthodoxe und Fanatiker aller Arten &uuml;ber ihre
Gegner abgeurtheilt, ohne sie zu kennen oder auch nur kennen lernen zu wollen&ldquo; (Einleit. zum Menon, not. 15, p. 173).</p>

<p>Certainly orthodox and fanatical persons often do what is here imputed to them. But Steinhart might have found a still closer parallel with Anytus, in his own criticisms, and in those of many
other Platonic critics on the Sophists; the same expressions of bitterness and severity, with the same slender knowledge of the persons upon whom they bear.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_22_38" id="Sidenotev2_22_38"></a> The Menon brings forward the point of analogy between Sokrates and the Sophists, in which both were disliked by the
practical statesmen.</span></p>

<p>In many of the Platonic dialogues we have the antithesis between Sokrates and the Sophists brought out, as to the different point of view from which the one and <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page258" id="v2page258"></a>258</span>the other approached ethical questions. But in this portion of the Menon, we find exhibited the feature of analogy between them, in which both one and the
other stood upon ground obnoxious to the merely practical politicians. Far from regarding hatred against the Sophists as a mark of virtue in Anytus, Sokrates deprecates it as unwarranted and as
menacing to philosophy in all her manifestations. The last declaration ascribed to Anytus, coupled with the last speech of Sokrates in the dialogue, show us that Plato conceives the anti-Sophistic
antipathy as being anti-Sokratic also, in its natural consequences. That Sokrates was in common parlance a Sophist, disliked by a large portion of the general public, and ridiculed by Aristophanes,
on the same grounds as those whom Plato calls Sophists &mdash; is a point which I have noticed elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_1" id="Sidenotev2_23_1"></a> Scenic arrangement and personages of the dialogue.</span></p>

<p>The dialogue called Protagoras presents a larger assemblage of varied and celebrated characters, with more of dramatic winding, and more frequent breaks and resumptions in the conversation, than
any dialogue of Plato &mdash; not excepting even Symposion and Republic. It exhibits Sokrates in controversy with the celebrated Sophist Protagoras, in the presence of a distinguished society, most
of whom take occasional part in the dialogue. This controversy is preceded by a striking conversation between Sokrates and Hippokrates &mdash; a youth of distinguished family, eager to profit by the
instructions of Protagoras. The two Sophists Prodikus and Hippias, together with Kallias, Kritias, Alkibiades, Eryximachus, Ph&aelig;drus, Pausanias, Agathon, the two sons of Perikl&ecirc;s (Paralus
and Xanthippus), Charmides, son of Glaukon, Antim&oelig;rus of Mende, a promising pupil of Protagoras, who is in training for the profession of a Sophist &mdash; these and others are all present at
the meeting, which is held in the house of Kallias.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_1" href="#Footnotev2_23_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Sokrates himself recounts the whole &mdash; both his conversation
with Hippokrates and that with Protagoras &mdash; to a nameless friend.</p>

</div>

<p>This dialogue enters upon a larger and more comprehensive ethical theory than anything in the others hitherto noticed. But it contains also a great deal in which we hardly recognise, or at least
cannot verify, any distinct purpose, either of search or exposition. Much of it seems to be composed with a literary or poetical view, to enhance the charm or interest of the composition. The
personal characteristics of each speaker &mdash; the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page260" id="v2page260"></a>260</span> peculiarities of Prodikus and Hippias &mdash; the ardent
partisanship of Alkibiades &mdash; are brought out as in a real drama. But the great and marked antithesis is that between the Sophist Protagoras and Sokrates &mdash; the Hektor and Ajax of the
piece: who stand forward in single combat, exchange some serious blows, yet ultimately part as friends.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_2" id="Sidenotev2_23_2"></a> Introduction. Eagerness of the youthful Hippokrates to become acquainted with Protagoras.</span></p>

<p>An introduction of some length impresses upon us forcibly the celebrity of the Great Sophist, and the earnest interest excited by his visit to Athens. Hippokrates, a young man of noble family and
eager aspirations for improvement, having just learnt the arrival of Protagoras, comes to the house of Sokrates and awakens him before daylight, entreating that Sokrates will introduce him to the
new-comer. He is ready to give all that he possesses in order that he may become wise like Protagoras.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_2" href="#Footnotev2_23_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> While they are

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You are now intending to visit Protagoras, and to pay him for something to be done for you &mdash; tell me what manner of man it is that you are going to visit &mdash; and
what manner of man do you wish to become? If you were going in like manner to pay a fee for instruction to your namesake Hippokrates of Kos, you would tell me that you were going to him as to a
physician &mdash; and that you wished to qualify yourself for becoming a physician. If you were addressing yourself with the like view to Pheidias or Polykleitus, you would go to them as to
sculptors, and for the purpose of becoming yourself a sculptor. Now then that we are to go in all this hurry to Protagoras, tell me who he is and what title he bears, as we called Pheidias a
sculptor? <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; They call him a Sophist.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_4" href="#Footnotev2_23_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; We are going to pay him then as a Sophist?
<i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; Certainly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; And what are you to become by going to him? <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; Why, judging from the preceding analogies, I am to become a Sophist. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; But would not you be ashamed of presenting yourself to the Grecian public as a <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page261" id="v2page261"></a>261</span>Sophist? <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; Yes: if I
am to tell you my real opinion.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_5" href="#Footnotev2_23_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Perhaps however you only propose to visit Protagoras, as you
visited your schoolmaster and your musical or gymnastical teacher: not for the purpose of entering that career as a professional man, but to acquire such instruction as is suitable for a private
citizen and a freeman? <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; That is more the instruction which I seek from Protagoras. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do you know then what you are going to do? You are consigning your mind to
be treated by one whom you call a Sophist: but I shall be surprised if you know what a Sophist is<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_6" href="#Footnotev2_23_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> &mdash; and if you do
not know, neither do you know what it is &mdash; good or evil &mdash; to which you are consigning your mind. <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; I think I <i>do</i> know. The Sophist is, as the name implies, one
cognizant of matters wise and able.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_7" href="#Footnotev2_23_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; That may be said also of painters and carpenters. If we were
asked in what special department are painters cognizant of matters wise and able, we should specify that it was in the workmanship of portraits. Answer me the same question about the Sophist. What
sort of workmanship does he direct? <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; That of forming able speakers.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_8" href="#Footnotev2_23_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Your answer
may be correct, but it is not specific enough: for we must still ask, About <i>what</i> is it that the Sophist forms able speakers? just as the harp-master makes a man an able speaker about harping,
at the same time that he teaches him harping. About <i>what</i> is it that the Sophist forms able speakers: <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page262" id="v2page262"></a>262</span>of course about that
which he himself knows?<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_9" href="#Footnotev2_23_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; Probably. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What then is that, about which the Sophist
is himself cognizant, and makes his pupil cognizant? <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; By Zeus, I cannot give you any farther answer.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_10" href="#Footnotev2_23_10"><span class=

Platonic critics treat this <i>Sophistomanie</i> (as they call it) of an Athenian youth as something ludicrous and contemptible: all the more ludicrous because (they say) none of them goes to qualify
himself for becoming a Sophist, but would even be ashamed of the title. Yet if we suppose the same question addressed to a young Englishman of rank and fortune (as Hippokrates was at Athens),
&ldquo;Why do you put yourself under the teaching of Dr. &mdash; &mdash; at Eton or Professor &mdash; &mdash; at Oxford? Do you intend to qualify yourself for becoming a schoolmaster or a
professor?&rdquo; He will laugh at you for the question; if he answers it seriously, he will probably answer as Hippokrates does. But there is nothing at all in the question to imply that the
schoolmaster or the professor is a worthless pretender &mdash; or the youth foolish, for being anxious to obtain instruction from him; which is the inference that Ast and other Platonic critics
desire us to draw about the Athenian Sophists.</p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Do you see then to what danger you are going to submit your mind? If the question were about going to trusting your body to any one, with the risk whether it should become
sound or unsound, you would have thought long, and taken much advice, before you decided. But now, when it is about your mind, which you value more than your body, and upon the good or evil of which
all your affairs turn<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_11" href="#Footnotev2_23_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> &mdash; you are hastening without reflection and without advice, you are ready to pay all the
money that you possess or can obtain, with a firm resolution already taken to put yourself at all hazard under Protagoras: whom you do not know &mdash; with whom you have never once talked &mdash;
whom you call a Sophist, without knowing what a Sophist is? <i>Hipp.</i> &mdash; I must admit the case to be as you say.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_12" href="#Footnotev2_23_12"><span class=
"sp">12</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Perhaps the Sophist is a man who brings for sale those transportable commodities, instruction or doctrine, which form the nourishment of the mind. Now the
traders in food for the body praise indiscriminately all that they have to sell, though neither they nor their purchasers know whether it is good for the body; unless by chance any one of them be a
gymnastic trainer or a physician.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_13" href="#Footnotev2_23_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> So, too, these Sophists, who carry about food for the mind, praise all that they
have to sell: but perhaps some of them are ignorant, and assuredly their purchasers are ignorant, whether it be good or bad for the mind: unless by accident any one possess medical knowledge about
the mind. Now if you, Hippokrates, happen to possess such knowledge of what is good or bad for the mind, you may safely purchase doctrine from Protagoras or from any one else:<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_23_14" href="#Footnotev2_23_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> but if not, you are <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page263" id="v2page263"></a>263</span>hazarding and putting at stake
your dearest interests. The purchase of doctrines is far more dangerous than that of eatables or drinkables. As to these latter, you may carry them away with you in separate vessels, and before you
take them into your body you may invoke the <i>Expert</i>, to tell you what you may safely eat and drink, and when, and how much. But this cannot be done with doctrines. You cannot carry away <i>
them</i> in a separate vessel to be tested; you learn them and take them into the mind itself; so that you go away, after having paid your money, actually damaged or actually benefited, as the case
may be.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_15" href="#Footnotev2_23_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> We will consider these matters in conjunction with our elders. But first let us go and talk with Protagoras
&mdash; we can consult the others afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_5" id="Sidenotev2_23_5"></a> Remarks on the Introduction. False persuasion of knowledge brought to light.</span></p>

<p>Such is the preliminary conversation of Sokrates with Hippokrates, before the interview with Protagoras. I have given it (like the introduction to the Lysis) at considerable length, because it is
a very characteristic specimen of the Sokratico-Platonic point of view. It brings to light that false persuasion of knowledge, under which men unconsciously act, especially in what concerns the mind
and its treatment. Common fame and celebrity suffice to determine the most vehement aspirations towards a lecturer, in one who has never stopped to reflect or enquire what the lecturer does. The
pressure applied by Sokrates in his successive questions, to get beyond vague generalities into definite particulars &mdash; the insufficiency, thereby exposed, of the conceptions with which men
usually rest satisfied &mdash; exhibit the working of his Elenchus in one of its most instructive ways. The parallel drawn between the body and the mind &mdash; the constant precaution taken in the
case of the former to consult the professional man and to follow his advice in respect both to discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page264" id="v2page264"></a>264</span> and nourishment
&mdash; are in the same vein of sentiment which we have already followed in other dialogues. Here too, as elsewhere, some similar <i>Expert</i>, in reference to the ethical and intellectual training
of mind, is desiderated, as still more imperatively necessary. Yet where is he to be found? How is the business of mental training to be brought to a beneficial issue without him? Or is Protagoras
the man to supply such a demand? We shall presently see.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_6" id="Sidenotev2_23_6"></a> Sokrates and Hippokrates go to the house of Kallias. Company therein. Respect shown to Protagoras.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates and Hippokrates proceed to the house of Kallias, and find him walking about in the fore-court with Protagoras, and some of the other company; all of whom are described as treating the
Sophist with almost ostentatious respect. Prodikus and Hippias have each their separate hearers, in or adjoining to the court. Sokrates addresses Protagoras.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_7" id="Sidenotev2_23_7"></a> Questions of Sokrates to Protagoras. Answer of the latter, declaring the antiquity of the sophistical profession, and his
own openness in avowing himself a sophist.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Protagoras, I and Hippokrates here are come to talk to you about something. <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; Do you wish to ta]k to me alone, or in presence of the rest? <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; To us it is indifferent: but I will tell you what we come about, and you may then determine for yourself. This Hippokrates is a young man of noble family, and fully equal to his
contemporaries in capacity. He wishes to become distinguished in the city; and he thinks he shall best attain that object through your society. Consider whether you would like better to talk with him
alone, or in presence of the rest.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_16" href="#Footnotev2_23_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; Your consideration on my behalf, Sokrates, is reasonable. A
person of my profession must be cautious in his proceedings. I, a foreigner, visit large cities, persuading the youth of best family to frequent my society in preference to that of their kinsmen and
all others; in the conviction that I shall do them good. I thus inevitably become exposed to much jealousy and even to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page265" id="v2page265"></a>265</span>hostile
conspiracies.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_17" href="#Footnotev2_23_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> The sophistical art is an old one;<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_18" href="#Footnotev2_23_18"><span class=
"sp">18</span></a> but its older professors, being afraid of enmity if they proclaimed what they really were, have always disguised themselves under other titles. Some, like Homer, Hesiod, and
Simonides, called themselves poets: others, Orpheus, Mus&aelig;us, &amp;c., professed to prescribe religious rites and mysteries: others announced themselves as gymnastic trainers or teachers of
music. But I have departed altogether from this policy; which indeed did not succeed in really deceiving any leading men &mdash; whom alone it was intended to deceive &mdash; and which, when found
out, entailed upon its authors the additional disgrace of being considered deceivers. The true caution consists in open dealing; and this is what I have always adopted. I avow myself a Sophist,
educating men. I am now advanced in years, old enough to be the father of any of you, and have grown old in the profession: yet during all these years, thank God, I have suffered no harm either from
my practice or my title.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_19" href="#Footnotev2_23_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> If therefore you desire to converse with me, it will be far more agreeable to me to converse
in presence of all who are now in the house.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_20" href="#Footnotev2_23_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a></p>

<p>The motive assigned by Hippokrates, for putting himself under the teaching of Protagoras, is just the same as that which Xenophon assigns to his friend Proxenus for taking lessons and paying fees
to the Leontine Gorgias (Xen. Anab. ii. 6, 16).</p>

say that Protagoras died at the age of seventy; that he had practised forty years as a Sophist; and that during all that long time he had enjoyed the highest esteem and reputation, even after his
death, &ldquo;down to the present day&rdquo; (Menon, p. 91 E).</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the speech, of which I have just given an abstract, is delivered not by the historical, real, Protagoras, but by the character named <i>Protagoras</i>, depicted by Plato
in this dialogue: <i>i.e.</i> the speech is composed by Plato himself. I read, therefore, with much surprise, a note of Heindorf (ad p. 316 D), wherein he says about Protagoras: &ldquo;Callid&eacute;
in postremis reticet, quod addere poterat, &chi;&rho;&#942;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha; &delta;&iota;&delta;&#972;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&sigmaf;.&rdquo; &ldquo;Protagoras cunningly keeps back, what he might
have here added, that people gave him money for his teaching.&rdquo; Heindorf must surely have supposed that he was commenting upon a real speech, delivered by the historical person called
Protagoras. Otherwise what can be meant by this charge of &ldquo;cunning reticence or keeping back?&rdquo; Protagoras here speaks what Plato puts into his mouth; neither more nor less. What makes the
remark of Heindorf the more preposterous is, that in page 328 B the very fact, which Protagoras is here said &ldquo;cunningly to keep back,&rdquo; appears mentioned by Protagoras; and mentioned in
the same spirit of honourable frankness and fair-dealing as that which pervades the discourse which I have just (freely) translated. Indeed nothing can be more marked than the way in which Plato
makes Protagoras dwell with emphasis on the frankness and openness of his dealing: nothing can be more at variance with the character which critics give us of the Sophists, as &ldquo;cheats, who
defrauded pupils of their money while teaching them nothing at all, or what they themselves knew to be false&rdquo;.</p>

assembled company.</span></p>

<p>On hearing this, Sokrates &mdash; under the suspicion (he tells us) that Protagoras wanted to show off in the presence of Prodikus and Hippias &mdash; proposes to convene all the dispersed guests,
and to talk in their hearing. This is accordingly done, and the conversation recommences &mdash; Sokrates repeating the introductory request which he had preferred on behalf of Hippokrates.</p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Hippokrates is anxious to distinguish himself in the city, and thinks that he shall best attain this end by placing himself under your instruction. He would gladly learn,
Protagoras, what will happen to him, if he comes into intercourse with you. <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; Young man, if you come to me, on the day of your first visit, you will go home better than you came,
and on the next day the like: each successive day you will make progress for the better.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_21" href="#Footnotev2_23_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Of
course he will; there is nothing surprising in that: but towards <i>what</i>, and about <i>what</i>, will he make progress? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; Your question is a reasonable one, and I am glad to
reply to it. I shall not throw him back &mdash; as other Sophists do, with mischievous effect &mdash; into the special sciences, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music, &amp;c., just after he has
completed his course in them. I shall teach him what he really comes to learn: wisdom and good counsel, both respecting his domestic affairs, that he may manage his own family well &mdash; and
respecting the affairs of the city, that he may address himself to them most efficaciously, both in speech and act. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You speak of political or social science. You engage to make

specialty which they regard as learnable and teachable, they will listen to no one except a professional artist or craftsman.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_24" href="#Footnotev2_23_24"><span class=
"sp">24</span></a> If any non-professional man presumes to advise them on the subject, they refuse to hear him, however rich and well-born he may be. It is thus that they act in matters of any
special art;<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_25" href="#Footnotev2_23_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> but when the debate turns upon the general administration of the city, they hear every man alike &mdash; the
brass-worker, leather-cutter, merchant, navigator, rich, poor, well-born, low-born, &amp;c. Against none of them is any exception taken, as in the former case &mdash; that he comes to give advice on
that which he has not learnt, and on which he has had no master.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_26" href="#Footnotev2_23_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> It is plain that the public generally think it not
teachable. Moreover our best and wisest citizens, those who possess civic virtue in the highest measure, cannot communicate to their own children this same virtue, though they cause them to be taught
all those accomplishments which paid masters can impart. Perikl&ecirc;s and others, excellent citizens themselves, have never been able to make any one else excellent, either in or out of their own
family. These reasons make me conclude that social or political virtue is not teachable. I shall be glad if you can show me that it is so.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_27" href="#Footnotev2_23_27"><span

<p>There was once a time when Gods existed, but neither men nor <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page268" id="v2page268"></a>268</span>animals had yet come into existence. At the epoch prescribed by
Fate, the Gods fabricated men and animals in the interior of the earth, out of earth, fire, and other ingredients: directing the brothers Prometheus and Epimetheus to fit them out with suitable
endowments. Epimetheus, having been allowed by his brother to undertake the task of distributing these endowments, did his work very improvidently, wasted all his gifts upon the inferior animals, and
left nothing for man. When Prometheus came to inspect what had been done, he found that other animals were adequately equipped, but that man had no natural provision for clothing, shoeing, bedding,
or defence. The only way whereby Prometheus could supply the defect was, by breaking into the common workshop of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; and Heph&aelig;stus, and stealing from thence their artistic skill,
together with fire.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_29" href="#Footnotev2_23_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> Both of these he presented to man, who was thus enabled to construct for himself, by art, all

<p>Still however, mankind did not possess the political or social art; which Zeus kept in his own custody, where Prometheus could not reach it. Accordingly, though mankind could provide for

supply the wants of the entire community? Or are they to be apportioned in a certain dose to every man? Undoubtedly, to every man (was the command of Zeus). All without exception must be partakers in

possessed by all citizens and taught by all to all.</span></p>

<p>This fable will show you, therefore, Sokrates (continues Protagoras), that the Athenians have good reason for making the distinction to which you advert. When they are discussing matters of
special art, they will hear only the few to whom such matters are known. But when they are taking counsel about social or political virtue, which consists altogether in justice and moderation, they
naturally hear every one; since every one is presumed, as a condition of the existence of the commonwealth, to be a partaker therein.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_33" href="#Footnotev2_23_33"><span class=
"sp">33</span></a> Moreover, even though they know a man not to have these virtues in reality, they treat him as insane if he does not proclaim himself to have them, and make profession of virtue:
whereas, in the case of the special arts, if a man makes <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page270" id="v2page270"></a>270</span>proclamation of his own skill as a physician or musician, they censure

<p>Nevertheless, though they account this political or social virtue an universal endowment, they are far from thinking that it comes spontaneously or by nature. They conceive it to be generated by
care and teaching. For in respect of all those qualities which come by nature or by accident, no one is ever angry with another or blames another for being found wanting. An ugly, dwarfish, or sickly
man is looked upon simply with pity, because his defects are such as he cannot help. But when any one manifests injustice or other qualities the opposite of political virtue, then all his neighbours
visit him with indignation, censure, and perhaps punishment: implying clearly their belief that this virtue is an acquirement obtained by care and learning.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_35" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> Indeed the whole institution of punishment has no other meaning. It is in itself a proof that men think social virtue to be acquirable and acquired.
For no rational man ever punishes malefactors because they <i>have</i> done wrong, or simply with a view to the past:&mdash; since what is already done cannot be undone. He punishes with a view to
the future, in order that neither the same man, nor others who see him punished, may be again guilty of similar wrong. This opinion plainly implies the belief, that virtue is producible by training,
since men punish for the purpose of prevention.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_36" href="#Footnotev2_23_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a></p>

<p>This clear and striking exposition of the theory of punishment is one of the most memorable passages in Plato, or in any ancient author. And if we are to believe the words which immediately
follow, it was the theory universally accepted at that time &mdash; &tau;&alpha;&#973;&tau;&eta;&nu; &omicron;&#8022;&nu; &tau;&#8052;&nu; &delta;&#972;&xi;&alpha;&nu;
&pi;&#940;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &#7956;&chi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&nu;, &#8005;&sigma;&omicron;&iota; &pi;&epsilon;&rho;
&tau;&iota;&mu;&omega;&rho;&omicron;&#8166;&nu;&tau;&alpha;&iota; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#7984;&delta;&#943;&#8115; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&sigma;&#943;&#8115;. Compare Plato,
Legg. xi. p. 933, where the same doctrine is announced: Seneca, De Ir&acirc;, i. 16. &ldquo;Nam, ut Plato ait, nemo prudens punit, quia peccatum est, sed ne peccetur. Revocari enim pr&aelig;terita
non possunt: futura prohibentur.&rdquo; Steinhart (Einleit. zum Protag. p. 423) pronounces a just encomium upon this theory of punishment, which, as he truly observes, combines together the purposes
declared in the two modern theories &mdash; Reforming and Deterring. He says further, however, that the same theory of punishment reappears in the Gorgias, which I do not think exact. The purpose of
punishment, as given in the Gorgias, is simply to cure a distempered patient of a terrible distemper, and thus to confer great benefit on him &mdash; but without any allusion to tutelary results as
regards society.</p>

eminent.</span></p>

<p>I come now to your remaining argument, Sokrates. You urge that citizens of eminent civil virtue cannot communicate that virtue to their own sons, to whom nevertheless they secure all the
accomplishments which masters can teach. Now I have already shown you that civil virtue is the one accomplishment needful,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_37" href="#Footnotev2_23_37"><span class=
"sp">37</span></a> which every man without exception must possess, on pain of punishment or final expulsion, if he be without it. I have shown you, moreover that every one believes it to be
communicable by teaching and attention. How can you believe then that these excellent fathers teach their sons other things, but do not teach them this, the want of which entails such terrible
penalties?</p>

<p>The fact is, they <i>do</i> teach it: and that too with great pains.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_38" href="#Footnotev2_23_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> They begin to admonish and lecture their
children, from the earliest years. Father, mother, tutor, nurse, all vie with each other to make the child as good as possible: by constantly telling him on every occasion which arises, This is right
&mdash; That is wrong &mdash; This is honourable &mdash; That is mean &mdash; This is holy &mdash; That is unholy &mdash; Do these things, abstain from those.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_39" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> If the child obeys them, it is well: if he do not, they straighten or rectify him, like a crooked piece of wood, by reproof and flogging. Next, they
send him to a schoolmaster, who teaches him letters and the harp; but who is enjoined to take still greater pains in watching over his orderly behaviour. Here the youth is put to read, learn by
heart, and recite, the compositions of able poets; full of exhortations to excellence and of stirring examples from the good men of past times.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_40" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> On the harp also, he learns the best songs, his conduct is strictly watched, and his emotions are disciplined by the influence of rhythmical and
regular measure. While his mind is thus trained to good, he is sent besides to the gymnastic trainer, to render his body a suitable instrument for it,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_41" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> and to guard against <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page272" id="v2page272"></a>272</span>failure of energy under the obligations of military
service. If he be the son of a wealthy man, he is sent to such training sooner, and remains in it longer. As soon as he is released from his masters, the city publicly takes him in hand, compelling
him to learn the laws prescribed by old and good lawgivers,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_42" href="#Footnotev2_23_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> to live according to their prescriptions, and to learn
both command and obedience, on pain of being punished. Such then being the care bestowed, both publicly and privately, to foster virtue, can you really doubt, Sokrates, whether it be teachable? You
might much rather wonder if it were not so.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_43" href="#Footnotev2_23_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a></p>

<p>How does it happen, then, you ask, that excellent men so frequently have worthless sons, to whom, even with all virtue from these precautions, they cannot teach their own virtue? This is not
surprising, when you recollect what I have just said &mdash; That in regard to social virtue, every man must be a craftsman and producer; there must be no non-professional consumers.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_23_44" href="#Footnotev2_23_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> All of us are interested in rendering our neighbours just and virtuous, as well as in keeping them so. Accordingly, every
one, instead of being jealous, like a professional artist, of seeing his own accomplishments diffused, stands forward zealously in teaching justice and virtue to every one else, and in reproving all
short-comers.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_45" href="#Footnotev2_23_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> Every man is a teacher of virtue to others: every man learns his virtue from such general teaching,
public and private. The sons of the best men learn it in this way, as well as others. The instruction of their fathers counts for comparatively little, amidst such universal and paramount extraneous
influence; so that it depends upon the aptitude and predispositions of the sons themselves, whether they turn out better or worse than others. The son of a superior man will often turn out ill; while
the son of a worthless man will <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page273" id="v2page273"></a>273</span>prove meritorious. So the case would be, if playing on the flute were the one thing needful for
all citizens; if every one taught and enforced flute-playing upon all others, and every one learnt it from the teaching of all others.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_46" href="#Footnotev2_23_46"><span class=
"sp">46</span></a> You would find that the sons of good or bad flute-players would turn out good or bad, not in proportion to the skill of their fathers, but according to their own natural aptitudes.
You would find however also, that all of them, even the most unskilful, would be accomplished flute-players, if compared with men absolutely untaught, who had gone through no such social training. So
too, in regard to justice and virtue.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_47" href="#Footnotev2_23_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> The very worst man brought up in your society and its public and private
training, would appear to you a craftsman in these endowments, if you compared him with men who had been brought up without education, without laws, without dikasteries, without any general social
pressure bearing on them, to enforce virtue: such men as the savages exhibited last year in the comedy of Pherekrates at the Len&aelig;an festival. If you were thrown among such men, you, like the
chorus of misanthropes in that play, would look back with regret even upon the worst criminals of the society which you had left, such as Eurybatus and Phrynondas.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_48" href=

professo</i><a name="FnAnchorv2_23_49" href="#Footnotev2_23_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> By the same analogy, if you asked who was the teacher for speaking our vernacular Greek, no one special
person could be pointed out:<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_50" href="#Footnotev2_23_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> nor would you find out who was the finishing teacher for those sons of craftsmen who
learnt the rudiments of their art from their own fathers &mdash; while if the son of any non-professional person learns a craft, it is easy to assign the person by whom he was taught.<a name=

enforce virtue to the best of our power; and we ought to be satisfied if there be any one of us ever so little superior to the rest, in the power of teaching it. Of such men I believe myself to be
one.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_52" href="#Footnotev2_23_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> I can train a man into an excellent citizen, better than others, and in a manner worthy not only of the fee
which I ask, but even of a still greater remuneration, in the judgment of the pupil himself. This is the stipulation which I make with him: when he has completed his course, he is either to pay me
the fee which I shall demand &mdash; or if he prefers, he may go into a temple, make oath as to his own estimate of the instruction imparted to him, and pay me according to that estimate.<a name=

propagates and perpetuates itself.</span></p>

<p>Such is the discourse composed by Plato and attributed to the Platonic Protagoras &mdash; showing that virtue is teachable, and intended to remove the difficulties proposed by Sokrates. It is an
exposition of some length: and because it is put into the mouth of a Sophist, many commentators presume, as a matter of course, that it must be a manifestation of some worthless quality:<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_23_55" href="#Footnotev2_23_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> that it is either empty verbiage, or ostentatious self-praise, or low-minded immorality. I am unable to perceive in the
discourse any of these demerits. I think it one of the best parts of the Platonic writings, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page275" id="v2page275"></a>275</span>as an exposition of the growth and
propagation of common sense &mdash; the common, established, ethical and social sentiment, among a community: sentiment neither dictated in the beginning, by any scientific or artistic lawgiver, nor
personified in any special guild of craftsmen apart from the remaining community &mdash; nor inculcated by any formal professional teachers &mdash; nor tested by analysis &mdash; nor verified by
comparison with any objective standard: but self-sown and self-asserting, stamped, multiplied, and kept in circulation, by the unpremeditated conspiracy of the general<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_56" href=

<p>The account given by Mr. James Mill (Fragment on Mackintosh, p. 259-260) of the manner in which the established morality of a society is transmitted and perpetuated, coincides completely with the
discourse of the Platonic Protagoras. The passage is too long to be cited: I give here only the concluding words, which describe the &delta;&eta;&mu;&omicron;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8052;
&#7936;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&#8052; &#7940;&nu;&epsilon;&upsilon; &phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf; &mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this manner it is that men, in the social state, acquire the habits of moral acting, and certain affections connected with it, before they are capable of reflecting upon the grounds
which recommend the acts either to praise or blame. Nearly at this point the greater part of them remain: continuing to perform moral acts and to abstain from the contrary, chiefly from the habits
which they have acquired, and the authority upon which they originally acted: though it is not possible that any man should come to the years and blessing of reason, without perceiving at least in an
indistinct and general way, the advantage which mankind derive from their acting towards one another in one way rather than another.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_22" id="Sidenotev2_23_22"></a> Antithesis of Protagoras and Sokrates. Whether virtue is to be assimilated to a special art.</span></p>

<p>In many of the Platonic dialogues, Sokrates is made to dwell upon the fact that there are no recognised professional teachers of virtue; and to ground upon this fact a doubt, whether virtue be
really teachable. But the present dialogue is the only one in which the fact is accounted for, and the doubt formally answered. There are neither special teachers, nor professed pupils, nor
determinate periods of study, nor definite lessons or stadia, for the acquirement of virtue, as there are for a particular art or craft: the reason being, that in that department every man must of
necessity be a practitioner, more or less perfectly: every man has an interest in communicating it to his neighbour: hence every man is constantly both teacher and learner. Herein consists one main
and real distinction between virtue and the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page276" id="v2page276"></a>276</span>special arts; an answer to the view most frequently espoused by the Platonic
Sokrates, assimilating virtue to a professional craft, which ought to have special teachers, and a special season of apprenticeship, if it is to be acquired at all.</p>

<p>The speech is censured by some critics as prolix. But to me it seems full of matter and argument, exceedingly free from superfluous rhetoric. The fable with which it opens presents of course the
poetical ornament which belongs to that manner of handling. It is however fully equal, in point of perspicuity as well as charm &mdash; in my judgment, it is even superior to any other fable in
Plato.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_23" id="Sidenotev2_23_23"></a> Procedure of Sokrates in regard to the discourse of Protagoras &mdash; he compliments it as an exposition, and analyses
some of the fundamental assumptions.</span></p>

<p>When the harangue, lecture, or sermon, of Protagoras is concluded, Sokrates both expresses his profound admiration of it, and admits the conclusion &mdash; That virtue is teachable &mdash; to be
made out, as well as it can be made out by any continuous exposition.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_57" href="#Footnotev2_23_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> In fact, the speaker has done all that could be
done by Perikles or the best orator of the assembly. He has given a long series of reasonings in support of his own case, without stopping to hear the doubts of opponents. He has sailed along
triumphantly upon the stream of public sentiment, accepting all the established beliefs &mdash; appealing to his hearers with all those familiar phrases, round which the most powerful associations
are grouped &mdash; and taking for granted that justice, virtue, good, evil, &amp;c., are known, indisputable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page277" id="v2page277"></a>277</span> determinate data,
fully understood, and unanimously interpreted. He has shown that the community take great pains, both publicly and privately, to inculcate and enforce virtue: that is, what <i>they</i> believe in and
esteem as virtue. But is their belief well founded? Is that which they esteem, really virtue? Do they and their elegant spokesman Protagoras, know what virtue is? If so, <i>how</i> do they know it,
and can they explain it?</p>

<p>Very different indeed is the sentiment of the principal Platonic commentators. Schleiermacher will not allow the mythus of Protagoras to be counted among the Platonic mythes: he says that it is
composed in the style of Protagoras, and perhaps copied from some real composition of that Sophist. He finds in it nothing but a &ldquo;grobmaterialistiche Denkungsart, die &uuml;ber die sinnliche
Erfahrung nicht hinaus philosophirt&rdquo; (Einleitung zum Protagoras, vol. i. pp. 233-234).</p>

<p>To the like purpose Ast (Plat. Leb. p. 71) &mdash; who tells us that what is expressed in the mythus is, &ldquo;the vulgar and mean sentiment and manner of thought of the Sophist: for it deduces
every thing, both arts and the social union itself, from human wants and necessity&rdquo;. Apparently these critics, when they treat this as a proof of meanness and vulgarity, have forgotten that the
Platonic Sokrates himself does exactly the same thing in the Republic &mdash; deriving the entire social union from human necessities (Republ. ii. 369 C).</p>

<p>K. F. Hermann is hardly less severe upon the Protagorean discourse (Gesch. und Syst. der Plat. Phil. p. 460).</p>

<p>For my part, I take a view altogether opposed to these learned persons. I think the discourse one of the most striking and instructive portions of the Platonic writings: and if I could believe
that it was the composition of Protagoras himself, my estimation of him would be considerably raised.</p>

<p>Steinhart pronounces a much more rational and equitable judgment than Ast and Schleiermacher, upon the discourse of Protagoras (Einleitung zum Prot. pp. 422-423).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_24" id="Sidenotev2_23_24"></a> One purpose of the dialogue. To contrast continuous discourse with short cross-examining question and
answer.</span></p>

<p>This is the point upon which Sokrates now brings his Elenchus to bear: his method of short question and answer. We have seen what long continuous speaking can do: we have now to see what short
cross-questioning can do. The antithesis between the two is at least one main purpose of Plato &mdash; if it be not even <i>the</i> purpose (as Schleiermacher supposes it to be) in this memorable
dialogue.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_25" id="Sidenotev2_23_25"></a> Questions by Sokrates &mdash; Whether virtue is one and indivisible, or composed of different parts? Whether the parts
are homogeneous or heterogeneous?</span></p>

<p>After your copious exposition, Protagoras (says Sokrates), I have only one little doubt remaining, which you will easily explain.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_58" href="#Footnotev2_23_58"><span class=
"sp">58</span></a> You have several times spoken of justice, moderation, holiness, &amp;c., as if they all, taken collectively, made up virtue. Do you mean that virtue is a Whole, and that these three
names denote distinct parts of it? Or are the three names all equivalent to virtue, different names for one and are the same thing? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; They are names signifying distinct parts of
virtue. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Are these parts like the parts of the face, &mdash; eyes, nose, mouth, ears &mdash; each part not only distinct from the rest, but having its own peculiar properties? Or
are they like the parts of gold, homogeneous with each other and with the whole, differing only in magnitude? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; The former. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then some men may possess one part,
some another. Or is it necessary that he who possesses one part, should possess all? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; By no means necessary. Some men are courageous, but unjust: others are just, but not
intelligent. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Wisdom and courage then, both of them, are parts of virtue? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; They are so. Wisdom is the greatest of the parts: but no one of the parts is the
exact likeness of another: each of them has its own peculiar property.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_59" href="#Footnotev2_23_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a></p>

<p>This passage seems intended to illustrate the indifference of Protagoras for dialectic forms and strict accuracy of discussion. The
&#7936;&kappa;&rho;&iota;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#943;&alpha; of Sokrates and Plato was not merely unfamiliar but even distasteful to rhetorical and practical men. Protagoras is made
to exhibit himself as thinking the distinctions drawn by Sokrates too nice, not worth attending to. Many of the contemporaries of both shared this opinion. One purpose of our dialogue is to bring
such antitheses into view.</p>

<p>Sokrates then attempts to show that intelligence and moderation are identical with each other (&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&alpha; and &sigma;&omega;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#973;&nu;&eta;). The
proof which he produces, elicited by several questions, is &mdash; that both the one and the other are contrary to folly (&#7936;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#973;&nu;&eta;), and, that as a general
rule, nothing can have more than one single contrary.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_65" href="#Footnotev2_23_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_28" id="Sidenotev2_23_28"></a> Insufficient reasons given by Sokrates. He seldom cares to distinguish different meanings of the same term.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates thus seems to himself to have made much progress in proving all the names of different virtues to be names of one and the same thing. Moderation and intelligence are shown to be the same:
justice and holiness had before been shown to be nearly the same:<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_66" href="#Footnotev2_23_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> though we must recollect that this last point had
not been admitted by Protagoras. It must be confessed however that neither the one nor the other is proved by any conclusive reasons. In laying down the maxim &mdash; that nothing can have more than
one single contrary &mdash; Plato seems to have forgotten that the same term may be used in two different senses. Because the term folly (&#7936;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#973;&nu;&eta;), is used
sometimes to denote the opposite of moderation (&sigma;&omega;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#973;&nu;&eta;), sometimes the opposite of intelligence (&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#943;&alpha;), it does not
follow that moderation and intelligence are the same thing.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_67" href="#Footnotev2_23_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> Nor does he furnish more satisfactory proof of the other
point, <i>viz.</i>: That holiness and justice are the same, or as much alike as possible. The intermediate position which is assumed to form the proof, <i>viz.</i>: That holiness is holy, and that
justice is just &mdash; is either tautological, or unmeaning; and cannot serve as a real proof of any thing. It is indeed so futile, that if it were found in the <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page280" id="v2page280"></a>280</span>mouth of Protagoras and not in that of Sokrates, commentators would probably have cited it as an illustration of the futilities of the Sophists. As yet
therefore little has been done to elucidate the important question to which Sokrates addresses himself &mdash; What is the extent of analogy between the different virtues? Are they at bottom one and
the same thing under different names? In what does the analogy or the sameness consist?</p>

important point (as I have already remarked, <a href="#v2page170">vol. ii. p. 170</a>) in which he is superior to Plato is, in being far more careful to distinguish the different meanings of the same

<p>But though little progress has been made in determining the question mooted by Sokrates, enough has been done to discompose and mortify Protagoras. The general tenor of the dialogue is, to depict
this man, so eloquent in popular and continuous exposition, as destitute of the analytical acumen requisite to meet cross-examination, and of promptitude for dealing with new aspects of the case, on
the very subjects which form the theme of his eloquence. He finds himself brought round, by a series of short questions, to a conclusion which &mdash; whether conclusively proved or not &mdash; is
proved in a manner binding upon him, since he has admitted all the antecedent premisses. He becomes dissatisfied with himself, answers with increasing reluctance,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_68" href=

<p>Meanwhile Sokrates pursues his examination, with intent to prove that justice (&delta;&iota;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&sigma;&#973;&nu;&eta;) and moderation
(&sigma;&omega;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&#973;&nu;&eta;) are identical. Does a man who acts unjustly conduct himself with moderation? I should be ashamed (replies Protagoras) to answer in the
affirmative, though many people say so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; It is indifferent to me whether you yourself think so or not, provided only you consent to make answer. What I principally examine is the

that there exist certain things called good things. Are those things good, which are profitable to mankind? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; By Zeus, I call some things good, even though they be not profitable

<p>The explanation here given by Protagoras of <i>good</i> is the same as that which is given by the historical Sokrates himself in the Xenophontic Memorabilia (iii. 8). Things called good are
diverse in the highest degree; but they are all called <i>good</i> because they all contribute in some way to human security, relief, comfort, or prosperity. To one or other of these ends <i>
good</i>, in all its multifarious forms, is relative.</p>

you ask me now, I had always talked just as my opponent wished, I should never have acquired any reputation at all. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Be it so: in that case I must retire; for as to long speaking,

<p>Here Sokrates rises to depart; but Kallias, the master of the house, detains him, and expresses an earnest wish that the debate may be continued. A promiscuous conversation ensues, in which most
persons present take part. Alkibiades, as the champion of Sokrates, gives, what seems really to be the key of the dialogue, when he says &mdash; &ldquo;Sokrates admits that he has no capacity for long
speaking, and that he is no match therein for Protagoras. But as to dialectic debate, or administering and resisting cross-examination, I should be surprised if any one were a match for him. If
Protagoras admits that on this point he is inferior, Sokrates requires no more: if he does not, let him continue the debate: but he must not lengthen his answers so that hearers lose the thread of
the subject.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Sokrates acknowledges the superiority of Protagoras in rhetoric: if Protagoras acknowledges the superiority of Sokrates in dialectic, Sokrates is satisfied.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_74"

shall be continued. At length Sokrates consents to remain, yet on condition that Protagoras shall confine himself within the limits of the dialectic procedure. Protagoras (he says) shall first
question me as long as he pleases: when he has finished, I will question him. The Sophist, though at first reluctant, is constrained, by the instance of those around, to accede to this proposition.<a

<p>For the purpose of questioning, Protagoras selects a song of Simonides: prefacing it with a remark, that the most important accomplishment of a cultivated man consists in being thorough master of

had represented that the sophistical art was ancient:<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_80" href="#Footnotev2_23_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> and that the poets, from Homer downward, were Sophists, but
dreaded the odium of the name, and professed a different avocation with another title. Sokrates here tells us that philosophy was more ancient still in Krete and Sparta, and that there were more
Sophists (he does not distinguish between the Sophist and the philosopher), female as well as male, in those regions, than anywhere else: but that they concealed their name and profession, for fear
that others should copy them and acquire the like <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page284" id="v2page284"></a>284</span>eminence:<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_81" href="#Footnotev2_23_81"><span class=
"sp">81</span></a> that they pretended to devote themselves altogether to arms and gymnastic &mdash; a pretence whereby (he says) all the other Greeks were really deluded. The special characteristic
of these philosophers or Sophists was, short and emphatic speech &mdash; epigram shot in at the seasonable moment, and thoroughly prostrating an opponent.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_82" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a> The Seven Wise Men, among whom Pittakus was one, were philosophers on this type, of supreme excellence: which they showed by inscribing their
memorable brief aphorisms at Delphi. So great was the celebrity which Pittakus acquired by his aphorism, that Simonides the poet became jealous, and composed this song altogether for the purpose of
discrediting him. Having stated this general view, Sokrates illustrates it by going through the song, with exposition and criticism of several different passages.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_83" href=

Protagoras in continuous speech.</span></p>

<p>No remark is made by any one present, either upon the circumstance that Sokrates, after protesting against long speeches, has here delivered one longer by far than the first speech of Protagoras,
and more than half as long as the second, which contains a large theory &mdash; nor upon the sort of interpretation that he bestows upon the Simonidean song. That interpretation is so strange and
forced &mdash; so violent in distorting the meaning of the poet &mdash; so evidently predetermined by the resolution to find Platonic metaphysics in a lyric effusion addressed to a Thessalian
prince<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_85" href="#Footnotev2_23_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a> &mdash; that if such an exposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page285" id="v2page285"></a>285</span> had
been found under the name of Protagoras, critics would have dwelt upon it as an additional proof of dishonest perversions by the Sophists.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_86" href="#Footnotev2_23_86"><span
class="sp">86</span></a> It appears as if Plato, intending in this dialogue to set out the contrast between long or continuous speech (sophistical, rhetorical, poetical) represented by Protagoras,
and short, interrogatory speech (dialectical) represented by Sokrates &mdash; having moreover composed for Protagoras in the earlier part of the dialogue, an harangue claiming venerable antiquity for
his own accomplishment &mdash; has thought it right to compose for Sokrates a pleading with like purpose, to put the two accomplishments on a par. And if that pleading includes both pointless irony
and misplaced comparisons (especially what is said about the Spartans) &mdash; we must remember that Sokrates has expressly renounced all competition with Protagoras in continuous speech, and that he
is here handling the weapon in which he is confessedly inferior. Plato secures a decisive triumph to dialectic, and to Sokrates as representing it: but he seems content here to leave Sokrates on the
lower ground as a rhetorician.</p>

ii. p. 147 D. In both these cases, Sokrates cites passages of poetry, assigning to them a sense which their authors plainly did not intend them to bear. Heindorf in his note on the Lysis (l. c.)
observes &mdash; &ldquo;Videlicet, ut exeat sententia, quam Solon ne somniavit quidem, versuum horum structuram, neglecto plan&eacute; sermonis usu, hanc statuit. &mdash; Cujusmodi interpretationis

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_38" id="Sidenotev2_23_38"></a> Sokrates depreciates the value of debates on the poets. Their meaning is always disputed, and you can never ask from
themselves what it is. Protagoras consents reluctantly to resume the task of answering.</span></p>

<p>Moreover, when Sokrates intends to show himself off as a master of poetical lore (&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &#7952;&pi;&#8182;&nu; &delta;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&#8056;&sigmaf;), he at the same time
claims a right of interpreting the poets in his own way. He considers the poets either as persons divinely inspired, who speak fine things without rational understanding (we have seen this in the
Apology and the Ion) &mdash; or as men of superior wisdom, who deliver valuable truth lying beneath the surface, and not discernible by vulgar eyes. Both these views differ from that of literal
interpretation, which is here represented by Protagoras and Prodikus. And these two Sophists are here contrasted with Sokrates as interpreters of the poets. Protagoras and Prodikus look upon poetical
compositions as sources of instruction:<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page286" id="v2page286"></a>286</span> and seek to interpret them literally, as an intelligent hearer would have understood
them when they were sung or recited for the first time. Towards that end, discrimination of the usual or grammatical meaning of words was indispensable. Sokrates, on the contrary, disregards the
literal interpretation, derides verbal distinctions as useless, or twists them into harmony with his own purpose: Simonides and other poets are considered as superior men, and even as inspired men in
whose verses wisdom and virtue must be embodied and discoverable<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_87" href="#Footnotev2_23_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> &mdash; only that they are given in an obscure and
enigmatical manner: requiring to be extracted by the divination of the philosopher, who alone knows what wisdom and virtue are. It is for the philosopher to show his ingenuity by detecting the traces
of them. This is what Sokrates does with the song of Simonides. He discovers in it supposed underlying thoughts (&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf;):<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_88"
href="#Footnotev2_23_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a> distinctions of Platonic Metaphysics (between &epsilon;&#7990;&nu;&alpha;&iota; and &gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&#941;&sigma;&theta;&alpha;&iota;), and
principles of Platonic Ethics (&omicron;&#8016;&delta;&epsilon;&#8054;&sigmaf; &#7957;&kappa;&omega; &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&#972;&sigmaf;) &mdash; he proceeds to point out passages in which they are
to be found, and explains the song conformably to them, in spite of much violence to the obvious meaning and verbal structure.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_89" href="#Footnotev2_23_89"><span class=
"sp">89</span></a> But though Sokrates accepts, when required, the task of discussing what is said by the poets, and deals with them according to his own point of view &mdash; yet he presently lets
us see that they are witnesses called into <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page287" id="v2page287"></a>287</span>court by his opponent and not by himself. Alkibiades urges that the debate which had
been interrupted shall be resumed and Sokrates himself requests Protagoras to consent. &ldquo;To debate about the compositions of poets&rdquo; (says Sokrates), &ldquo;is to proceed as silly and
common-place men do at their banquets: where they cannot pass the time without hiring musical or dancing girls. Noble and well-educated guests, on the contrary, can find enough to interest them in
their own conversation, even if they drink ever so much wine.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_90" href="#Footnotev2_23_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a> Men such as we are, do not require to be amused by
singers nor to talk about the poets, whom no one can ask what they mean; and who, when cited by different speakers, are affirmed by one to mean one thing, and by another to mean something else,
without any decisive authority to appeal to. Such men as you and I ought to lay aside the poets, and test each other by colloquy of our own. If you wish to persist in questioning, I am ready to
answer: if not, consent to answer me, and let us bring the interrupted debate to a close.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_91" href="#Footnotev2_23_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a></p>

<p>The distinction was similar in character, and even more marked in respect of earnest reciprocal antipathy, between the different schools of the Jews in Alexandria and Palestine about the

<p>In spite of this appeal, Protagoras is still unwilling to resume, and is only forced to do so by a stinging taunt from Alkibiades, enforced by requests from Kallias and others. He is depicted as
afraid of Sokrates, who, as soon as consent is given, recommences the discussion by saying &mdash; &ldquo;Do not think, Protagoras, that I have any other purpose in debating, except to sift through

<p>The remark here given should be carefully noted in appreciating the Sokratic frame of mind. The cross-examination which he bestows, is not that of one who himself knows &mdash; and who only gets
up artificial difficulties to ascertain whether others know as much as he does. On the contrary, it proceeds from one who is himself puzzled; and that which puzzles him he states to others,
and debates with others, as affording the best chance of clearing up his own ideas and obtaining a solution.</p>

Protagoras, said that intelligence, moderation, justice, holiness, courage, were all parts of virtue; but each different from the others, and each having a separate essence and properties of its own.
Do you still adhere to that opinion? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; I now think that the first four are tolerably like and akin to each other, but that courage is very greatly different from all the four. The

<p>Sokrates then shows that the courageous men are confident men, forward in dashing at dangers, which people in general will not affront: that men who dive with confidence into the water, are those

Aristotle in the Nikomachean Ethics cites and criticises the opinion of Sokrates, wherein the latter affirmed the irresistible supremacy of knowledge, when really possessed, over all passions and
desires. Aristotle cites it with the express phraseology and illustration contained in this passage of the Protagoras. &#7960;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#940;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu;

The same metaphor &pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&#941;&lambda;&kappa;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota; &#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta; is again ascribed to Sokrates by Aristotle, a little farther on
in the same treatise, p. 1147, b. 15.</p>

<p>We see from hence that when Aristotle comments upon <i>the doctrine of Sokrates</i>, what he here means is, the doctrine of the Platonic Sokrates in the Protagoras; the citation of this particular
metaphor establishes the identity.</p>

<p>In another passage of the Nikom. Eth., Aristotle also cites a fact respecting the Sophist Protagoras, which fact is mentioned in the Platonic dialogue Protagoras &mdash; respecting the manner in
which that Sophist allowed his pupils to assess their own fee for his teaching (Ethic. Nik. ix. 1, 1164, a. 25).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_45" id="Sidenotev2_23_45"></a> Pleasure is the only good &mdash; pain the only evil. No man does evil voluntarily, knowing it to be evil. Difference
between pleasures present and future &mdash; resolves itself into pleasure and pain.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; It thus appears that you pursue pleasure as good, and avoid pain as evil. Pleasure is what you think good: pain is what you think evil: for even pleasure itself appears to you
evil, when it either deprives you of pleasures greater than itself, or entails upon you pains outweighing itself. Is there any other reason, or any other ulterior end, to which you look when you
pronounce pleasure to be evil? If there be any other between reason, or any other end, tell us what it is.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_109" href="#Footnotev2_23_109"><span class="sp">109</span></a> <i>
Prot.</i> &mdash; There is none whatever. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The case is similar about pains: you call pain good, when it preserves you from greater pains, or procures for you a future balance of
pleasure. If there be any other end to which you look when you call pain good, tell us what it is. <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; You speak truly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If I am asked why I insist so much on the
topic now before us, I shall reply, that it is no easy matter to explain what is meant by being overcome by pleasure; and that the whole proof hinges upon this point &mdash; whether there is any
other good than pleasure, or any other evil than pain; and whether it be not sufficient, that we should go through life pleasurably and without pains.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_110" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a> If this be sufficient, and if no other good or evil can be pointed out, which does not end in pleasures and pains, mark the consequences. Good and
evil being identical with pleasurable and painful, it is ridiculous to say that a man does evil voluntarily, knowing it to be evil, under the overpowering influence of pleasure: that is, under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page293" id="v2page293"></a>293</span>overpowering influence of good.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_111" href="#Footnotev2_23_111"><span class="sp">111</span></a> How can it
be wrong, that a man should yield to the influence of good? It never can be wrong, except in this case &mdash; when the good obtained is of smaller amount than the consequent good forfeited or the
consequent evil entailed. What other exchangeable value can there be between pleasures and pains, except in the ratio of quantity &mdash; greater or less, more or fewer?<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_112"
href="#Footnotev2_23_112"><span class="sp">112</span></a> If an objector tells me that there is a material difference between pleasures and pains of the moment, and pleasures and pains postponed to a
future time, I ask him in reply, Is there any other difference, except in pleasure and pain? An intelligent man ought to put them both in the scale, the pleasures and the pains, the present and the
future, so as to determine the balance. Weighing pleasures against pleasures, he ought to prefer the more and the greater: weighing pains against pains, the fewer and the less. If pleasures against
pains, then when the latter outweigh the former, reckoning distant as well as near, he ought to abstain from the act: when the pleasures outweigh, he ought to do it. <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; The
objectors could have nothing to say against this.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_113" href="#Footnotev2_23_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a></p>

greater from the less, whether far or near, would not our safety reside in knowledge, and in a certain knowledge of mensuration too, in Arithmetic? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; They would concede to you that
also. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Well then, my friends, since the security of our lives has been found to depend on the right choice of pleasure and pain &mdash; between the more and fewer, greater and

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_47" id="Sidenotev2_23_47"></a> To do wrong, overcome by pleasure, is only a bad phrase for describing what is really a case of grave
ignorance.</span></p>

<p>For when <i>we</i> (Protagoras and Sokrates) affirmed, that nothing was more powerful than science or knowledge, and that this, in whatsoever minds it existed, prevailed over pleasure and every
thing else &mdash; <i>you</i> (the supposed objectors) maintained, on the contrary, that pleasure often prevailed over knowledge even in the instructed man: and you called upon us to explain, upon
our principles, what that mental affection was, which people called, being overcome by the seduction of pleasure. We have now shown you that this mental affection is nothing else but ignorance, and
the gravest ignorance. You have admitted that those who go wrong in the choice of pleasures and pains &mdash; that is, in the choice of good and evil things &mdash; go wrong from want of knowledge,
of the knowledge or science of mensuration. The wrong deed done from want of knowledge, is done through ignorance. What you call being overcome by pleasure is thus, the gravest ignorance; which these
Sophists, Protagoras, Prodikus, and Hippias, engage to cure: but you (the objectors whom we now address) not believing it to be ignorance, or <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page295" id="v2page295">
</a>295</span>perhaps unwilling to pay them their fees, refuse to visit them, and therefore go on doing ill, both privately and publicly.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_116" href="#Footnotev2_23_116"><span

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_48" id="Sidenotev2_23_48"></a> Reasoning of Sokrates assented to by all. Actions which conduct to pleasures or freedom from pain, are
honourable.</span></p>

<p>Now then, Protagoras, Prodikus, and Hippias (continues Sokrates), I turn to you, and ask, whether you account my reasoning true or false? (All of them pronounced it to be surpassingly true.) <i>
Sokr.</i> &mdash; You all agree, then, all three, that the pleasurable is good, and that the painful is evil:<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_117" href="#Footnotev2_23_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a> for
I take no account at present of the verbal distinctions of Prodikus, discriminating between the <i>pleasurable</i>, the <i>delightful</i>, and the <i>enjoyable</i>. If this be so, are not all those
actions, which conduct to a life of pleasure or to a life free from pain, honourable? and is not the honourable deed, good and profitable?<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_118" href="#Footnotev2_23_118"><span
class="sp">118</span></a> (In this, all persons present concurred.) If then the pleasurable is good, no one ever does anything, when he either knows or believes other things in his power to be
better. To be inferior to yourself is nothing else than ignorance: to be superior to yourself, is nothing else than wisdom. Ignorance consists in holding false opinions, and in being deceived
respecting matters of high importance. (Agreed by all.) Accordingly, no one willingly enters upon courses which are evil, or which he believes to be evil; nor is it in the nature of man to enter upon
what he thinks evil courses, in preference to good. When a man is compelled to make choice between two evils, no one will take the greater when he might take the less.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_119"
href="#Footnotev2_23_119"><span class="sp">119</span></a> (Agreed to by all three.) Farther, no one will affront things of which he is afraid, when other things are open to him, of which he is not
afraid: for fear is an expectation of evil, so that what a man fears, he of course thinks to be an evil, &mdash; and will not approach it willingly. (Agreed.)<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_120" href=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_49" id="Sidenotev2_23_49"></a> Explanation of courage. It consists in a wise estimate of things terrible and not terrible.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Let us now revert to the explanation of courage, given by Protagoras. He said that four out of the five parts of virtue were tolerably similar; but that courage <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page296" id="v2page296"></a>296</span>differed greatly from all of them. And he affirmed that there were men distinguished for courage; yet at the same time eminently unjust,
immoderate, unholy, and stupid. He said, too, that the courageous men were men to attempt things which timid men would not approach. Now, Protagoras, what are these things which the courageous men
alone are prepared to attempt? Will they attempt terrible things, believing them to be terrible? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; That is impossible, as you have shown just now. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; No one will
enter upon that which he believes to be terrible, &mdash; or, in other words, will go into evil knowing it to be evil: a man who does so is inferior to himself &mdash; and this, as we have agreed, is
ignorance, or the contrary of knowledge. All men, both timid and brave, attempt things upon which they have a good heart: in this respect, the things which the timid and the brave go at, are the
same.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_121" href="#Footnotev2_23_121"><span class="sp">121</span></a> <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; How can this be? The things which the timid and the brave go at or affront, are quite
contrary: for example, the latter are willing to go to war, which the former are not. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Is it honourable to go to war, or dishonourable? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; Honourable. <i>
Sokr.</i> &mdash; If it be honourable, it must also be good:<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_122" href="#Footnotev2_23_122"><span class="sp">122</span></a> for we have agreed, in the preceding debate, that
all honourable things were good. <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; You speak truly.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_123" href="#Footnotev2_23_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a> I at least always persist in thinking so.
<i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Which of the two is it, who (you say) are unwilling to go into war; it being an honourable and good thing? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; The cowards. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But if going to
war be an honourable and good thing, it is also pleasurable? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; Certainly that has been admitted.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_124" href="#Footnotev2_23_124"><span class=
"sp">124</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Is it then knowingly that cowards refuse to go into war, which is both more honourable, better, and more pleasurable? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; We cannot say so,
without contradicting our preceding admissions. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; What about the courageous man? does not he affront or <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page297" id="v2page297"></a>297</span>go at
what is more honourable, better, and more pleasurable? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; It cannot be denied. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Courageous men then, generally, are those whose fears, when they are afraid, are
honourable and good &mdash; not dishonourable or bad: and whose confidence, when they feel confident, is also honourable and good?<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_125" href="#Footnotev2_23_125"><span class=
"sp">125</span></a> On the contrary, cowards, impudent men, and madmen, both fear, and feel confidence, on dishonourable occasions? <i>Prot.</i> &mdash; Agreed. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; When they thus
view with confidence things dishonourable and evil, is it from any other reason than from ignorance and stupidity? Are they not cowards from stupidity, or a stupid estimate of things terrible? And is
it not in this ignorance, or stupid estimate of things terrible, and things not terrible &mdash; that cowardice consists? Lastly,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_126" href="#Footnotev2_23_126"><span class=
"sp">126</span></a> &mdash; courage being the opposite of cowardice &mdash; is it not in the knowledge, or wise estimate, of things terrible and things not terrible, that courage consists?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_51" id="Sidenotev2_23_51"></a> Remarks on the dialogue. It closes without the least allusion to Hippokrates.</span></p>

<p>Such is the end of this long and interesting dialogue.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_131" href="#Footnotev2_23_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a> We remark with some surprise that it closes without any
mention of Hippokrates, and without a word addressed to him respecting his anxious request for admission to the society of Protagoras: though such request had been presented at the beginning, with
much emphasis, as the sole motive for the intervention<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page299" id="v2page299"></a>299</span> of Sokrates. Upon this point<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_132" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> the dialogue is open to the same criticism as that which Plato (in the Ph&aelig;drus) bestows on the discourse of Lysias: requiring that every
discourse shall be like a living organism, neither headless nor footless, but having extremities and a middle piece adapted to each other.</p>

<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> I do not agree with this view. I can admit no dialogue earlier than 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>: and I consider the Protagoras to belong to Plato&rsquo;s full

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_52" id="Sidenotev2_23_52"></a> Two distinct aspects of ethics and politics exhibited: one under the name of Protagoras; the other, under that of
Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>In our review of this dialogue, we have found first, towards the beginning, an expository discourse from Protagoras, describing the maintenance and propagation of virtue in an established
community: next, towards the close, an expository string of interrogatories by Sokrates, destined to establish the identity of Good with Pleasurable, Evil with Painful; and the indispensable
supremacy of the calculating or measuring science, as the tutelary guide of human life. Of the first, I speak (like other critics) as the discourse of Protagoras: of the second, as the theory of
Sokrates. But I must again remind the reader, that both the one and the other are compositions of Plato; both alike are offspring of his ingenious and productive imagination. Protagoras is not the
author of that which appears here under his name: and when we read the disparaging epithets which many critics affix to his discourse, we must recollect that these epithets, if they were
well-founded, would have no real application to the historical Protagoras, but only to Plato himself. He has set forth two aspects, distinct and in part opposing, of ethics and politics: and he has
provided a worthy champion for each. Philosophy, or &ldquo;reasoned truth,&rdquo; if it be attainable at all, cannot most certainly be attained without such many-sided handling: still less can that
which Plato calls knowledge be attained &mdash; or such command of philosophy as will enable a man to stand a Sokratic cross-examination in it.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_53" id="Sidenotev2_23_53"></a> Order of ethical problems, as conceived by Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>In the last speech of Sokrates in the dialogue,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_133" href="#Footnotev2_23_133"><span class="sp">133</span></a> we find him proclaiming, that the first of all problems to be
solved was, What virtue really is? upon which there prevails serious confusion of opinions. It was a second question &mdash; important, yet still second and presupposing the solution of the first
&mdash; Whether virtue is teachable? We <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page300" id="v2page300"></a>300</span>noticed the same judgment as to the order of the two questions delivered by Sokrates in
the Menon.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_134" href="#Footnotev2_23_134"><span class="sp">134</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">

"#v2page242">p. <span class="correction" title="amended from 240">242</span></a>.</p>

<p>Upon this order, necessarily required, of the two questions, Schleiermacher has a pertinent remark in his general Einleitung to the works of Plato, p. 26. Eberhard (he says) affirms that the end
proposed by Plato in his dialogues was to form the minds of the noble Athenian youth, so as to make them virtuous citizens. Schleiermacher controverts the position of Eberhard; maintaining
&ldquo;that this is far too subordinate a standing-point for philosophy, &mdash; besides that it is reasoning in a circle, since philosophy has first to determine what the virtue of a citizen
is&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_54" id="Sidenotev2_23_54"></a> Difference of method between him and Protagoras flows from this difference of order. Protagoras assumes what virtue is,
without enquiry.</span></p>

<p>Now the conception of ethical questions in this order &mdash; the reluctance to deal with the second until the first has been fully debated and settled &mdash; is one fundamental characteristic of
Sokrates. The difference of method, between him and Protagoras, flows from this prior difference between them in fundamental conception. What virtue is, Protagoras neither defines nor analyses, nor
submits to debate. He manifests no consciousness of the necessity of analysis: he accepts the ground already prepared for him by King Nomos: he thus proceeds as if the first step had been made sure,
and takes his departure from hypotheses of which he renders no account &mdash; as the Platonic Sokrates complains of the geometers for doing.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_135" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_135"><span class="sp">135</span></a> To Protagoras, social or political virtue is a known and familiar datum, about which no one can mistake: which must be possessed, in greater or
less measure, by every man, as a condition of the existence of society: which every individual has an interest in promoting in all his neighbours: and which every one therefore teaches and enforces
upon every one else. It is a matter of common sense or common sentiment, and thus stands in contrast with the special professional accomplishments; which are confined only to a few &mdash; and the
possessors, teachers, and learners of which are each an assignable section of the society. The parts or branches of virtue are, in like manner, assumed by him as known, in their relations to each
other and to the whole. This persuasion of knowledge, without preliminary investigation, he adopts from the general public, with whom he is in communion of sentiment. What they accept and enforce as
virtue, he accepts and enforces also.</p>

<p>Again, the method pursued by Protagoras, is one suitable to a teacher who has jumped over this first step; who assumes virtue, as something fixed in the public sentiments &mdash; and addresses
himself to those sentiments, ready-made as he finds them. He expands and illustrates them in continuous lectures of some length, which fill both the ears and minds of the listener &mdash;
&ldquo;Spartam nactus es, hanc exorna&rdquo;: he describes their growth, propagation, and working in the community: he gives interesting comments on the poets, eulogising the admired heroes who form
the theme of their verses, and enlarging on their admonitions. Moreover, while resting altogether upon the authority of King Nomos, he points out the best jewel in the crown of that potentate; the
great social fact of punishment prospective, rationally apportioned, and employed altogether for preventing and deterring &mdash; instead of being a mere retrospective impulse, vindictive or
retributive for the past. He describes instructively the machinery operative in the community for ensuring obedience to what they think right: he teaches, in his eloquent expositions and
interpretations, the same morality, public and private, that every one else teaches: while he can perform the work of teaching, somewhat more effectively than they. Lastly, his method is essentially
showy and popular; intended for numerous assemblies, reproducing the established creeds and sentiments of those assemblies, to their satisfaction and admiration. He is prepared to be met and answered
in his own way, by opposing speakers; and he conceives himself more than a match for such rivals. He professes also to possess the art of short conversation or discussion. But in the exercise of this
art, he runs almost involuntarily into his more characteristic endowment of continuous speech: besides that the points which he raises for discussion assume all the fundamental principles, and turn
only upon such applications of those principles as are admitted by most persons to be open questions, not foreclosed by a peremptory orthodoxy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_56" id="Sidenotev2_23_56"></a> Method of Sokrates. Dwells upon that part of the problem which Protagoras had left out.</span></p>

<p>Upon all these points, Sokrates is the formal antithesis of Protagoras. He disclaims altogether the capacities to which that Sophist lays claim. Not only he cannot teach virtue, but he professes
not to know what it is, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page302" id="v2page302"></a>302</span>nor whether it be teachable at all, He starts from a different point of view: not considering virtue as
a known datum, or as an universal postulate, but assimilating it to a special craft or accomplishment, in which a few practitioners suffice for the entire public: requiring that in this capacity it
shall be defined, and its practitioners and teachers pointed out. He has no common ground with Protagoras; for the difficulties which he moots are just such as the common consciousness (and
Protagoras along with it) overleaps or supposes to be settled. His first requirement, advanced under the modest guise of a small doubt<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_136" href="#Footnotev2_23_136"><span
class="sp">136</span></a> which Protagoras must certainly be competent to remove, is, to know &mdash; What virtue is? What are the separate parts of virtue &mdash; justice, moderation, holiness,
&amp;c.? What is the relation which they bear to each other and to the whole &mdash; virtue? Are they homogeneous, differing only in quantity or has each of them its own specific essence and
peculiarity?<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_137" href="#Footnotev2_23_137"><span class="sp">137</span></a> Respecting virtue as a whole, we must recollect, Protagoras had discoursed eloquently and
confidently, as of a matter perfectly known. He is now called back as it were to meet an attack in the rear: to answer questions which he had never considered, and which had never even presented
themselves to him as questions. At first he replies as if the questions offered no difficulty;<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_138" href="#Footnotev2_23_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a> sometimes he does
not feel their importance, so that it seems to him a matter of indifference whether he replies in the affirmative or negative.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_139" href="#Footnotev2_23_139"><span class=
"sp">139</span></a> But he finds himself brought round, by a series of questions, to assent to conclusions which he nevertheless thinks untrue, and which are certainly unwelcome. Accordingly, he
becomes more and more disgusted with the process of analytical interrogation: and at length answers with such impatience and prolixity, that the interrogation can no longer be prosecuted. Here comes
in the break &mdash; the remonstrance of Sokrates &mdash; and the mediation of the by-standers.</p>

analytical cross-examiner.</span></p>

<p>It is this antithesis between the eloquent popular lecturer, and the analytical enquirer and cross-examiner, which the dialogue seems mainly intended to set forth. Protagoras professes to know
that which he neither knows, nor has ever tried to probe to the bottom. Upon this false persuasion of knowledge, the Sokratic Elenchus is brought to bear. We are made to see how strange, repugnant,
and perplexing, is the process of analysis to this eloquent expositor: how incompetent he is to go through it without confusion: how little he can define his own terms, or determine the limits of
those notions on which he is perpetually descanting.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_58" id="Sidenotev2_23_58"></a> Protagoras not intended to be always in the wrong, though he is described as brought to a contradiction.</span></p>

<p>It is not that Protagoras is proved to be wrong (I speak now of this early part of the conversation, between chapters 51-62 &mdash; pp. 329-335) in the substantive ground which he takes. I do not
at all believe (as many critics either affirm or imply) that Plato intended all which he in the composed under the name of Protagoras to be vile perversion of truth, with nothing but empty words and
exorbitant pretensions. I do not even believe that Plato intended all those observations, to which the name of Protagoras is prefixed, to be accounted silly &mdash; while all that is assigned to
Sokrates,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_140" href="#Footnotev2_23_140"><span class="sp">140</span></a> is admirable sense and acuteness. It is by no means certain that Plato intended to be understood as
himself endorsing the opinions which he ascribes everywhere to Sokrates: and it is quite certain that he does not always make the Sokrates of one dialogue consistent with the Sokrates of another. For
the purpose of showing the incapacity of the respondent to satisfy the exigencies of analysis, we need not necessarily suppose that the conclusion to which the questions conduct should be a true one.
If the respondent be brought, through his own admissions, to a contradiction, this is enough to prove that he did not know the subject deeply enough to make the proper answers and distinctions.</p>

only in conformity with the common opinion, but are quite true, though Sokrates is made to dispute them. Moreover, the arguments employed by Sokrates (including in those arguments the strange
propositions that justice is just, and that holiness is holy) are certainly noway conclusive.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_142" href="#Footnotev2_23_142"><span class="sp">142</span></a> Though Protagoras,
becoming entangled in difficulties, and incapable of maintaining his consistency against an embarrassing cross-examination, is of course exhibited as ignorant of that which he professes to know

many men are courageous who are neither just, nor temperate, nor virtuous in other respects. Sokrates contradicts the position. But in the Treatise De Legibus (i. p. 630 B), Plato himself says same
thing as Protagoras is here made to say: at least assuming that the Athenian speaker in De Legg. represents the sentiment of Plato himself at the time when he composed that treatise.</p>

<p>To say &ldquo;Justice is just,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Holiness is holy,&rdquo; is indeed either mere tautology, or else an impropriety of speech. Dr. Hutcheson observes on an analogous case: &ldquo;None
can apply moral attributes to the very faculty of perceiving moral qualities: or call his moral Sense morally Good or Evil, any more than he calls the power of tasting, sweet or bitter &mdash; or the
power of seeing, straight or crooked, white or black&rdquo; (Hutcheson on the Passions, sect. i. p. 234).</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_60" id="Sidenotev2_23_60"></a> The harsh epithets applied by critics to Protagoras are not borne out by the dialogue. He stands on the same ground as
the common consciousness.</span></p>

<p>As to the arrogant and exorbitant pretensions which the Platonic commentators ascribe to Protagoras, more is said than the reality justifies. He pretends to know what virtue, justice, moderation,
courage, &amp;c., are, and he is proved not to know. But this is what every one else pretends to know also, and what every body else teaches as well as he &mdash; &ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c Janus summus ab
imo Perdocet: h&aelig;c recinunt juvenes dictata senesque</i>&rdquo;. What he pretends to do, beyond the general public, he really can do. He can discourse, learnedly and eloquently, upon these
received doctrines and sentiments: he can enlist the feelings and sympathies of the public in favour of that which he, in common with the public, believes to be good &mdash; and against that which he
and they believe to be bad:<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page305" id="v2page305"></a>305</span> he can thus teach virtue more effectively than others. But whether that which is received as virtue,
be really such &mdash; he has never analysed or verified: nor does he willingly submit to the process of analysis. Here again he is in harmony with the general public; for they hate, as much as he
does, to be dragged back to fundamentals, and forced to explain, defend, revise, or modify, their established sentiments and maxims: which they apply as <i>principia</i> for deduction to particular
cases, and which they recognise as axioms whereby other things are to be tried, not as liable to be tried themselves. Protagoras is one of the general public, in dislike of, and inaptitude for,
analysis and dialectic discussion: while he stands above them in his eloquence and his power of combining, illustrating, and adorning, received doctrines. These are points of superiority, not
pretended, but real.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_61" id="Sidenotev2_23_61"></a> Aversion of Protagoras for dialectic. Interlude about the song of Simonides.</span></p>

<p>The aversion of Protagoras for dialectic discussion &mdash; after causing an interruption of the ethical argument, and an interlude of comment on the poet Simonides &mdash; is at length with
difficulty overcome, and the argument is then resumed. The question still continues, What is virtue? What are the five different parts of virtue? Yet it is so far altered that Protagoras now admits
that the four parts of virtue which Sokrates professed to have shown to be nearly identical, really are tolerably alike: but he nevertheless contends that courage is very different from all of them,
repeating his declaration that many men are courageous, but unjust and stupid at the same time. This position Sokrates undertakes to refute. In doing so, he lays out one of the largest, most
distinct, and most positive theories of virtue, which can be found in the Platonic writings.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_62" id="Sidenotev2_23_62"></a> Ethical view given by Sokrates worked out at length clearly. Good and evil consist in right or wrong calculation of
pleasures and pains of the agent.</span></p>

<p>Virtue, according to this theory, consists in a right measurement and choice of pleasures and pains: in deciding correctly, wherever we have an alternative, on which side lies the largest pleasure
or the least pain &mdash; and choosing the side which presents this balance. To live pleasurably, is pronounced to be good: to live without pleasure or in pain, is evil. Moreover, nothing but
pleasure, or comparative mitigation of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page306" id="v2page306"></a>306</span>pain, is good: nothing but pain is evil.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_143" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_143"><span class="sp">143</span></a> Good, is identical with the greatest pleasure or least pain: evil, with greatest pain: meaning thereby each pleasure and each pain when looked at
along with its consequences and concomitants. The grand determining cause and condition of virtue is knowledge: the knowledge, science, or art, of correctly measuring the comparative value of
different pleasures and pains. Such knowledge (the theory affirms), wherever it is possessed, will be sure to command the whole man, to dictate all his conduct, and to prevail over every temptation
of special appetite or aversion. To say that a man who knows on which side the greatest pleasure or the least pain lies, will act against his knowledge &mdash; is a mistake. If he acts in this way,
it is plain that he does not possess the knowledge, and that he sins through ignorance.</p>

<p>Locke says, &lsquo;Essay on Human Understanding,&rsquo; Book ii. ch. 28, &ldquo;Good or Evil is nothing but pleasure or pain to us &mdash; or that which procures pleasure or pain to us. Moral good
or evil then is only the conformity or disagreement of our voluntary actions to some law, whereby good or evil is drawn on us by the will and power of the law-maker; which good or evil, pleasure or
pain, attending our observance or breach of the law, is that we call reward or punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The formal distinction here taken by Locke between pleasure and that which procures pleasure &mdash; both the one and the other being called Good &mdash; (the like in regard to pain and evil) is
not distinctly stated by Sokrates in the Protagoras, though he says nothing inconsistent with it: but it is distinctly stated in the Republic, ii. p. 357, where Good is distributed under three heads.
1. That which we desire immediately and for itself &mdash; such as Enjoyment, Innocuous pleasure. 2. That which we desire both for itself and for its consequences &mdash; health, intelligence, good
sight or hearing, &amp;c. 3. That which we do not desire (perhaps even shun) for itself, but which we accept by reason of its consequences in averting greater pains or procuring greater pleasures.</p>

<p>This discrimination of the varieties of Good, given in the Republic, is quite consistent with what is stated by Sokrates in the Protagoras, though it is more full and precise. But it is not
consistent with what Sokrates says in the Gorgias, where he asserts a radical dissimilarity of nature between &#7969;&delta;&#8058; and &#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#972;&nu;.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_63" id="Sidenotev2_23_63"></a> Protagoras is at first opposed to this theory.</span></p>

<p>Protagoras agrees with Sokrates in the encomiums bestowed on the paramount importance and ascendancy of knowledge: but does not at first agree with him in identifying good with pleasure, and evil
with pain. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page307" id="v2page307"></a>307</span>Upon this point, too, he is represented as agreeing in opinion with the Many. He does not admit that to live
pleasurably is good, unless where a man takes his pleasure in honourable things. He thinks it safer, and more consistent with his own whole life, to maintain &mdash; That pleasurable things, or
painful things, may be either good, or evil, or indifferent, according to the particular case.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_64" id="Sidenotev2_23_64"></a> Reasoning of Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>This doctrine Sokrates takes much pains to refute. He contends that pleasurable things, so far forth as pleasurable, are always good &mdash; and painful things, so far forth as painful, always
evil. When some pleasures are called evil, that is not on account of any thing belonging to the pleasure itself, but because of its ulterior consequences and concomitants, which are painful or
distressing in a degree more than countervailing the pleasure. So too, when some pains are pronounced to be good, this is not from any peculiarity in the pain itself, but because of its consequences
and concomitants: such pain being required as a condition to the attainment of health, security, wealth, and other pleasures or satisfactions more than counter-balancing. Sokrates challenges
opponents to name any other end, with reference to which things are called <i>good</i>, except their tendency to prevent or relieve pains and to ensure a balance of pleasure: he challenges them to
name any other end, with reference to which things are called <i>evil</i>, except their tendency to produce pains and to intercept or destroy pleasures. In measuring pleasures and pains against each
other, there is no other difference to be reckoned except that of greater or less, more or fewer. The difference between near and distant, does indeed obtrude itself upon us as a misleading element.
But it is the special task of the &ldquo;measuring science&rdquo; to correct this illusion &mdash; and to compare pleasures or pains, whether near or distant, according to their real worth: just as
we learn to rectify the illusions of the sight in regard to near and distant objects.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_65" id="Sidenotev2_23_65"></a> Application of that reasoning to the case of courage.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates proceeds to apply this general principle in correcting the explanation of courage given by Protagoras. He shows, or tries to show, that courage, like all the other branches of virtue,
consists in acting on a just estimate of comparative pleasures and pains. No man affronts evil, or the alternative of greater pain, knowing it <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page308" id=
"v2page308"></a>308</span>to be such: no man therefore adventures himself in any terrible enterprise, knowing it to be so: neither the brave nor the timid do this. Both the brave and the timid
affront that which they think not terrible, or the least terrible of two alternatives: but they estimate differently what is such. The former go readily to war when required, the latter evade it. Now
to go into war when required, is honourable: being honourable, it is good: being honourable and good, it is pleasurable. The brave know this, and enter upon it willingly: the timid not only do not
know it, but entertain the contrary opinion, looking upon war as painful and terrible, and therefore keeping aloof. The brave men fear what it is honourable to fear, the cowards what it is
dishonourable to fear: the former act upon the knowledge of what is really terrible, the latter are misled by their ignorance of it. Courage is thus, like the other virtues, a case of accurate
knowledge of comparative pleasures and pains, or of good and evil.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_144" href="#Footnotev2_23_144"><span class="sp">144</span></a></p>

429 C, 430 B, which is better stated there (though substantially the same opinion) than here in the Protagoras.</p>

<p>The opinion of the Platonic Sokrates may be illustrated by a sentence from the funeral oration delivered by Perikl&ecirc;s, Thucyd. ii. 43, fin.
&#7944;&lambda;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&omicron;&tau;&#941;&rho;&alpha; &gamma;&#8048;&rho; &#7936;&nu;&delta;&rho;&#943; &gamma;&epsilon; &phi;&rho;&#972;&nu;&eta;&mu;&alpha;

&theta;&#940;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; &mdash; which Dr. Arnold thus translates in his note: &ldquo;For more grievous to a man of noble mind is the misery which comes together with cowardice,
than the unfelt death which befalls him in the midst of his strength and hopes for the common welfare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So again in the Ph&aelig;don (p. 68) Sokrates describes the courage of the ordinary unphilosophical citizen to consist in braving death from fear of greater evils (which is the same view as that
of Sokrates in the Protagoras), while the philosopher is courageous on a different principle; aspiring only to reason and intelligence, with the pleasures attending it, he welcomes death as releasing
his mind from the obstructive companionship of the body.</p>

<p>The fear of disgrace and dishonour, in his own eyes and in those of others, is more intolerable to the brave man than the fear of wounds and death in the service of his country. See Plato, Leg. i.
pp. 646-647. He is &phi;&omicron;&beta;&epsilon;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf; &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#8048; &nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon;, &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#8048; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&eta;&sigmaf;, p. 647 E.
Such is the way in which both Plato and Thucydides conceive the character of the brave citizen as compared with the coward.</p>

<p>It is plain that this resolves itself ultimately into a different estimate of prospective pains; the case being one in which pleasure is not concerned. That the pains of self-reproach and infamy
in the eyes of others are among the most agonising in the human bosom, need hardly be remarked. At the same time the sentiments here conceived embrace a wide field of sympathy, comprising the
interests, honour, and security, of others as well as of the individual agent.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_66" id="Sidenotev2_23_66"></a> The theory which Plato here lays down is more distinct and specific than any theory laid down in other
dialogues.</span></p>

<p>Such is the ethical theory which the Platonic Sokrates enunciates in this dialogue, and which Protagoras and others accept. It is positive and distinct, to a degree very unusual with Plato. We
shall find that <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page309" id="v2page309"></a>309</span>he theorises differently in other dialogues; whether for the better or the worse, will be hereafter seen. He
declares here explicitly that pleasure, or happiness, is the end to be pursued; and pain, or misery, the end to be avoided: and that there is no other end, in reference to which things can be called
good or evil, except as they tend to promote pleasure or mitigate suffering, on the one side &mdash; to entail pain or suffering on the other. He challenges objectors to assign any other end. And
thus much is certain &mdash; that in those other dialogues where he himself departs from the present doctrine, he has not complied with his own challenge. Nowhere has he specified a different end. In
other dialogues, as well as in the Protagoras, Plato has insisted on the necessity of a science or art of calculation: but in no other dialogue has he told us distinctly what are the items to be
calculated.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_67" id="Sidenotev2_23_67"></a> Remarks on the theory here laid down by Sokrates. It is too narrow, and exclusively prudential.</span></p>

<p>I perfectly agree with the doctrine laid down by Sokrates in the Protagoras, that pain or suffering is the End to be avoided or lessened as far as possible &mdash; and pleasure or happiness the
End to be pursued as far as attainable &mdash; by intelligent forethought and comparison: that there is no other intelligible standard of reference, for application of the terms Good and Evil, except
the tendency to produce happiness or misery: and that if this standard be rejected, ethical debate loses all standard for rational discussion, and becomes only an enunciation of the different
sentiments, authoritative and self-justifying, prevalent in each community. But the End just mentioned is highly complex, and care must be taken to conceive it in its full comprehension. Herein I
conceive the argument of Sokrates (in the Protagoras) to be incomplete. It carries attention only to a part of the truth, keeping out of sight, though not excluding, the remainder. It considers each
man as an individual, determining good or evil for himself by calculating his own pleasures and pains: as a prudent, temperate, and courageous agent, but neither as just nor beneficent. It omits to
take account of him as a member of a society, composed of many others akin or co-ordinate with himself. Now it is the purpose of an ethical or political reasoner (such as Plato both professes to be
and really is) to study the means of happiness, not simply for the agent <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page310" id="v2page310"></a>310</span>himself, but for that agent together with others around
him &mdash; for the members of the community generally.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_145" href="#Footnotev2_23_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a> The Platonic Sokrates says this himself in the Republic:
and accordingly, he there treats of other points which are not touched upon by Sokrates in the Protagoras. He proclaims that the happiness of each citizen must be sought only by means consistent with
the security, and to a certain extent with the happiness, of others: he provides as far as practicable that all shall derive their pleasures and pains from the same causes: common pleasures, and
common pains, to all.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_146" href="#Footnotev2_23_146"><span class="sp">146</span></a> The doctrine of Sokrates in the Protagoras requires to be enlarged so as to comprehend these
other important elements. Since the conduct of every agent affects the happiness of others, he must be called upon to take account of its consequences under both aspects, especially where it goes to
inflict hurt or privation upon others. Good and evil depend upon that scientific computation and comparison of pleasures and pains which Sokrates in the Protagoras prescribes: but the computation
must include, to a certain extent, the pleasures and pains (security and rightful expectations) of others besides the agent himself, implicated in the consequences of his acts.<a name=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_68" id="Sidenotev2_23_68"></a> Comparison with the Republic.</span></p>

<p>As to this point, we shall find the Platonic Sokrates not always correct, nor even consistent with himself. This will appear especially when we come to see the account which he gives of Justice in
the Republic. In that branch of the Ethical End, a direct regard to the security of others comes into the foreground. For in an act of injustice, the prominent characteristic is that of harm, done to
others &mdash; though that is not the whole, since the security of the agent himself is implicated with that of others in the general fulfilment of these obligations. It is this primary regard to
others, and secondary regard to self, implicated in one complex <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page311" id="v2page311"></a>311</span>feeling &mdash; which distinguishes justice from prudence. The
Platonic Sokrates in the Republic (though his language is not always clear) does not admit this; but considers justice as a branch of prudence, necessary to ensure the happiness of the individual
agent himself.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_69" id="Sidenotev2_23_69"></a> The discourse of Protagoras brings out an important part of the whole case, which is omitted in the analysis by
Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>Now in the Protagoras, what the Platonic Sokrates dwells upon (in the argument which I have been considering) is prudence, temperance, courage: little or nothing is said about justice: there was
therefore the less necessity for insisting on that prominent reference to the security of others (besides the agent himself) which justice involves. If, however, we turn back to the earlier part of
the dialogue, to the speech delivered by Protagoras, we see justice brought into the foreground. It is not indeed handled analytically (which is not the manner of that Sophist), nor is it resolved
into regard to pleasure and pain, happiness and misery: but it is announced as a social sentiment indispensably and reciprocally necessary from every man towards every other
(&delta;&#943;&kappa;&eta; &mdash; &alpha;&#7984;&delta;&#8060;&sigmaf;), distinguishable from those endowments which supply the wants and multiply the comforts of the individual himself. The very
existence of the social union requires, that each man should feel a sentiment of duties on his part towards others, and duties on their parts towards him: or (in other words) of rights on his part to
have his interests considered by others, and rights on their parts to have their interests considered by him. Unless this sentiment of reciprocity &mdash; reciprocal duty and right &mdash; exist in
the bosom of each individual citizen, or at least in the large majority &mdash; no social union could subsist. There are doubtless different degrees of the sentiment: moreover the rights and duties
may be apportioned better or worse, more or less fairly, among the individuals of a society; thus rendering the society more or less estimable and comfortable. But without a certain minimum of the
sentiment in each individual bosom, even the worst constituted society could not hold together. And it is this sentiment of reciprocity which Protagoras (in the dialogue before us) is introduced as
postulating in his declaration, that justice and the sense of shame (unlike to professional aptitudes) must be distributed universally and without exception among all the members <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page312" id="v2page312"></a>312</span>of a community. Each man must feel them, in his conduct towards others: each man must also be able to reckon that others will feel the like,
in their behaviour towards him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_148" href="#Footnotev2_23_148"><span class="sp">148</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_23_148" id="Footnotev2_23_148"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_23_148">148</a></span> Professor Bain (in his work on the Emotions and the Will, ch. xv.
On the Ethical Emotions, pp. 271-3) has given remarks extremely pertinent to the illustration of that doctrine which Plato has here placed under the name of Protagoras.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The supposed uniformity of moral distinctions resolves itself into the two following particulars. First, the common end of <i>public security</i>, which is also individual preservation,
demands certain precautions that are everywhere very much alike, and can in no case be dispensed with. Some sort of constituted authority to control the individual impulses and to protect each
man&rsquo;s person and property, must exist wherever a number of human beings live together. The duties springing out of this necessary arrangement are essentially the same in all societies.&hellip;
They have a pretty uniform character all over the globe. If the sense of the common safety were not sufficiently strong to constitute the social tie of obedience to some common regulations, society
could not exist.&hellip; It is no proof of the universal spread of a special innate faculty of moral distinctions, but of a certain rational appreciation of what is necessary for the very existence
of every human being living in the company of others: Doubtless, if the sad history of the human race had been preserved in all its details, we <i>should have many examples of tribes that perished
from being unequal to the conception of a social system, or to the restraints imposed by it</i>. We know enough of the records of anarchy, to see how difficult it is for human nature to comply in
full with the social conditions of security; but if this were not complied with at all, the result would be mutual and swift destruction.&hellip; In the second place, mankind have been singularly
unanimous in the practice of imposing upon individual members of societies some observances or restraints of purely <i>sentimental</i> origin, having no reference, direct or indirect, to the
maintenance of the social tie, with all the safeguards implied in it. Certain maxims founded in taste, liking, aversion, or fancy, have, in every community known to us, been raised to the dignity of
authoritative morality; being rendered (so to speak) &lsquo;terms of communion,&rsquo; and have been enforced by punishment.&hellip; In the rules, founded on men&rsquo;s sentiments, likings,
aversions, and antipathies, there is nothing common but the fact that some one or other of these are carried to the length of public requirement, and mixed up in one code with the imperative duties
that hold society together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The postulate of the Platonic Protagoras &mdash; that &delta;&#943;&kappa;&eta; and &alpha;&#7984;&delta;&#8060;&sigmaf; must be felt to a certain extent in each man&rsquo;s bosom, as a condition
to the very existence of society &mdash; agrees with the first of the two elements here distinguished by Mr. Bain, and does not necessarily go beyond it. But the unsystematic teaching and universal
propagandism, which Protagoras describes as the agency whereby virtue is communicated, applies alike to both the two elements distinguished by Mr. Bain: to the factitious exigencies of King Nomos, as
well as to his tutelary control. It is this mixed mass that the Sokratic analysis is brought to examine.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_70" id="Sidenotev2_23_70"></a> The Ethical End, as implied in the discourse of Protagoras, involves a direct regard to the pleasures and pains of
other persons besides the agent himself.</span></p>

<p>If we thus compare the Ethical End, as implied, though not explicitly laid down, by Protagoras in the earlier part of the dialogue, &mdash; and as laid down by Sokrates in the later part &mdash;
we shall see that while Sokrates restricts it to a true comparative estimate of the pains and pleasures of the agent himself, Protagoras enlarges it so as to include a direct reference to those of
others also, coupled with an expectation of the like <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page313" id="v2page313"></a>313</span>reference on the part of others.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_149" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_149"><span class="sp">149</span></a> Sokrates is satisfied with requiring from each person calculating prudence for his own pleasures and pains: while Protagoras proclaims that after
this attribute had been obtained by man, and individual wants supplied, still there was a farther element necessary in the calculation &mdash; the social sentiment or reciprocity of regard implanted
in every one&rsquo;s bosom: without this the human race would have perished. Prudence and skill will suffice for an isolated existence; but if men are to live and act in social communion, the
services as well as the requirements of each man must be shaped, in a certain measure, with a direct view to the security of others as well as to his own.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_23_149" id="Footnotev2_23_149"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_23_149">149</a></span> Plato, Protag. pp. 321-322.</p>
</div>

<p>In my judgment, the Ethical End, exclusively self-regarding, here laid down by Sokrates, is too narrow. And if we turn to other Platonic dialogues, we shall find Sokrates still represented as
proclaiming a self-regarding Ethical End, though not the same as what we read in the Protagoras. In the Gorgias, Republic, Ph&aelig;don, &amp;c., we shall find him discountenancing the calculation
(recommended in the Protagoras) of pleasures and pains against each other, as greater, more certain, durable, &amp;c., and insisting that all shall be estimated according as they bear on the general
condition or health of the mind, which he assimilates to the general condition or health of the body. The health of the body, considered as an End to be pursued, is essentially self-regarding: so
also is the health of the mind. I shall touch upon this farther when I consider the above-mentioned dialogues: at present, I only remark that they agree with the Sokrates of the Protagoras in
assuming a self-regarding Ethical End, though they do not agree with him in describing what that End should be.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_71" id="Sidenotev2_23_71"></a> Plato&rsquo;s reasoning in the dialogue is not clear or satisfactory, especially about courage.</span></p>

<p>The application which Sokrates makes (in the Protagoras) of his own assumed Ethical End to the explanation of courage, is certainly confused and unsatisfactory. And indeed, we may farther remark
that the general result at which Plato seems to be aiming in this dialogue, viz.: That all the different virtues are at the bottom one and the same, and that he who possesses<span class="pagenum"><a
name="v2page314" id="v2page314"></a>314</span> one of them must also possess the remainder &mdash; cannot be made out even upon his own assumptions. Though it be true that all the virtues depend upon
correct calculation, yet as each of them applies to a different set of circumstances and different disturbing and misleading causes, the same man who calculates well under one set of circumstances,
may calculate badly under others. The position laid down by Protagoras, that men are often courageous but unjust &mdash; just, but not wise &mdash; is noway refuted by Plato. Nor is it even
inconsistent with Plato&rsquo;s own theory, though he seems to think it so.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_72" id="Sidenotev2_23_72"></a> Doctrine of Stallbaum and other critics is not correct. That the analysis here ascribed to Sokrates is not intended by
Plato as serious, but as a mockery of the sophists.</span></p>

<p>Some of the Platonic commentators maintain,<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_150" href="#Footnotev2_23_150"><span class="sp">150</span></a> that the doctrine here explicitly laid down and illustrated by
Sokrates, <i>viz.</i>: the essential identity of the pleasurable with the good, of the painful with the evil &mdash; is to be regarded as not serious, but as taken up in jest for the purpose of
mocking and humiliating Protagoras. Such an hypothesis appears to me untenable; contradicted by the whole tenor of the dialogue. Throughout all the Platonic compositions, there is nowhere to be found
any train of argument more direct, more serious, and more elaborate, than that by which Sokrates here proves the identity of good with pleasure, of pain with evil (p. 351 to end). Protagoras begins
by denying it, and is only compelled to accept the conclusion against his own will, by the series of questions which he cannot otherwise answer.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_151" href=
"#Footnotev2_23_151"><span class="sp">151</span></a> Sokrates admits that the bulk of mankind are also opposed to it: but he establishes it with an ingenuity which is pronounced to be triumphant by
all the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page315" id="v2page315"></a>315</span>hearers around.<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_152" href="#Footnotev2_23_152"><span class="sp">152</span></a> The commentators
are at liberty to impeach the reasoning as unsound; but to set it aside as mere banter and mockery, is preposterous. Assume it even to be intended as mockery &mdash; assume that Sokrates is
mystifying the hearers, by a string of delusive queries, to make out a thesis which he knows to be untrue and silly &mdash; how can the mockery fall upon Protagoras, who denies the thesis from the
beginning?<a name="FnAnchorv2_23_153" href="#Footnotev2_23_153"><span class="sp">153</span></a> The irony, if it were irony, would be misplaced and absurd.</p>

<p>So too Ficinus says in his Argumentum to the Protagoras: (p. 765) &ldquo;Tum vero de bono et malo multa tractantur. Siquidem prudentia est scientia eligendi boni, malique vitandi. Ambigitur autem
utrum bonum malumque idem sit penitus quod et voluptas et dolor. <i>Neque affirmatur id quidem omnino, neque manifest&eacute; omnino negatur.</i> De hoc enim in Gorgi&acirc; Phileboque et
alibi,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>When a critic composes an Argument to the Protagoras, he is surely under obligation to report faithfully and exactly what is declared by Sokrates <i>in the Protagoras</i>, whether it be consistent
or not with the Gorgias and Phil&ecirc;bus. Yet here we find Ficinus misrepresenting the Protagoras, in order to force it into harmony with the other two.</p>

one which was maintained by Protagoras and the other Sophists (Proleg. p. 33), he says what is distinctly at variance with the dialogue, p. 351.</p>

<p>Schleiermacher maintains that this same thesis (the fundamental identity of good with pleasure, evil with pain) is altogether &ldquo;unsokratic and unplatonic&rdquo;; that it is handled here by
Sokrates in a manner visibly ironical (sichtbar ironisch); that the purpose of the argument is to show the stupidity of Protagoras, who is puzzled and imposed upon by such obvious fallacies
(Einleitung zum Protag. 230, bottom of p. 232), and who is made to exhibit (so Schleiermacher says, Einl. zum Gorgias, p. 14) a string of ludicrous absurdities.</p>

<p>Upon this I have to remark first, that if the stupidity of Protagoras is intended to be shown up, that of all the other persons present must be equally manifested; for all of them assent
emphatically, at the close, to the thesis as having been proved (Prot. p. 358 A): next, that I am unable to see either the absurdities of Protagoras or the irony of Sokrates, which Schleiermacher
asserts to be so visible. The argument of Sokrates is as serious and elaborate as any thing which we read in Plato. Schleiermacher seems to me to misconceive altogether (not only here but also in his
Einleitung zum Gorgias, p. 10) the concluding argument of Sokrates in the Protagoras. To describe the identity between &#7969;&delta;&#8058; and &#7936;&gamma;&alpha;&theta;&#8056;&nu; as a
&ldquo;scheinbare Voraussetzung&rdquo; is to depart from the plain meaning of words.</p>

<p>Again, Steinhart contends that Sokrates assumes this doctrine (identity of pleasure with good, pain with evil), &ldquo;not as his own opinion, but only hypothetically, with a sarcastic side-glance
at the absurd consequences which many deduced from it &mdash; only as the received world-morality, as the opinion of the majority&rdquo; (Einleit. zum Protag. p. 419). How Steinhart can find proof of
this in the dialogue, I am at a loss to understand. The dialogue presents to us Sokrates introducing the opinion as his own, against that of Protagoras and against that of the multitude (p. 351 C).
On hearing this opposition from Protagoras, Sokrates invites him to an investigation, whether the opinion be just; Sokrates then conducts the investigation himself, along with Protagoras, at
considerable length, and ultimately brings out the doctrine as proved, with the assent of all present.</p>

<p>These forced interpretations are resorted to, because the critics cannot bear to see the Platonic Sokrates maintaining a thesis substantially the same as that of Eudoxus and Epikurus. Upon this
point, K. F. Hermann is more moderate than the others; he admits the thesis to be seriously maintained in the dialogue &mdash; states that it was really the opinion of the historical Sokrates &mdash;
and adds that it was also the opinion of Plato himself during his early Sokratic stadium, when the Protagoras (as he thinks) was composed (Gesch. und Syst. der Plat. Phil. pp. 462-463).</p>

<p>Most of the critics agree in considering the Protagoras to be one of Plato&rsquo;s earlier dialogues, about 403 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Ast even refers it to 407 <span class="smcap">
B.C.</span> when Plato was about twenty-one years of age. I have already given my reasons for believing that none of the Platonic dialogues were composed before 399 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>
The Protagoras belongs, in my opinion, to Plato&rsquo;s most perfect and mature period.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_73" id="Sidenotev2_23_73"></a> Grounds of that doctrine. Their insufficiency.</span></p>

<p>The commentators resort to this hypothesis, partly because the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page316" id="v2page316"></a>316</span>doctrine in question is one which they disapprove &mdash;
partly because doctrines inconsistent with it are maintained in other Platonic dialogues. These are the same two reasons upon which, in other cases, various dialogues have been rejected as not
genuine works of Plato. The first of the two reasons is plainly irrelevant: we must accept what Plato gives us, whether we assent to it or not. The second reason also, I think, proves little. The
dialogues are distinct compositions, written each with its own circumstances and purpose: we have no right to require that they shall be all consistent with each other in doctrine, especially when we
look to the long philosophical career of Plato. To suppose that the elaborate reasoning of Sokrates in the latter portion of the Protagoras is mere irony, intended to mystify both Protagoras himself
and all the by-standers, who accept it as earnest and convincing &mdash; appears to me far less reasonable than the admission, that the dialectic pleading ascribed to Sokrates in one dialogue is
inconsistent with that assigned to him in another.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_23_74" id="Sidenotev2_23_74"></a> Subject is professedly still left unsettled at the close of the dialogue.</span></p>

<p>Though there is every mark of seriousness, and no mark of irony, in this reasoning of Sokrates, yet we must remember that he does not profess to leave the subject settled at the close of the
dialogue. On the contrary, he declares himself to be in a state of puzzle and perplexity. The question, proposed at the outset, Whether virtue is teachable? remains undecided.</p>

<p>Aristotle, in one of his lost dialogues, made honourable mention of a Corinthian cultivator, who, on reading the Platonic Gorgias, was smitten with such vehement admiration, that he abandoned his
fields and his vines, came to Athens forthwith, and committed himself to the tuition of Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_1" href="#Footnotev2_24_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> How much of reality there
may be in this anecdote, we cannot say: but the Gorgias itself is well calculated to justify such warm admiration. It opens with a discussion on the nature and purpose of Rhetoric, but is gradually
enlarged so as to include a comparison of the various schemes of life, and an outline of positive ethical theory. It is carried on by Sokrates with three distinct interlocutors &mdash; Gorgias,
Polus, and Kallikl&ecirc;s; but I must again remind the reader that all the four are only spokesmen prompted by Plato himself.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_2" href="#Footnotev2_24_2"><span class=
"sp">2</span></a> It may indeed be considered almost as three distinct dialogues, connected by a loose thread. The historical Gorgias, a native of Leontini in Sicily, was the most celebrated of the
Grecian rhetors; an elderly man during Plato&rsquo;s youth. He paid visits to different cities in all parts of Greece, and gave lessons in rhetoric to numerous pupils, chiefly young men of ambitious
aspirations.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_3" href="#Footnotev2_24_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

that Plato composed the Gorgias shortly after returning from his first voyage to Sicily, 387 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>I shall not contradict this: but I see nothing to prove it. At the same time, Schleiermacher assumes as certain that Aristophanes in the Ekklesiazus&aelig; alludes to the doctrines published by
Plato in his Republic (Einleitung zum Gorgias, p. 20). Putting these two statements together, the Gorgias would be later in date of composition than the Republic, which I hardly think probable.
However, I do not at all believe that Aristophanes in the Ekklesiazus&aelig; makes any allusion to the Republic of Plato. Nor shall I believe, until some evidence is produced, that the Republic was
composed at so early a date as 390 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

and Kallikl&ecirc;s.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates and Ch&aelig;rephon are described as intending to come to a rhetorical lecture of Gorgias, but as having been accidentally detained so as not to arrive until just after it has been
finished, with brilliant success. Kallikl&ecirc;s, however, the host and friend of Gorgias, promises that the rhetor will readily answer any questions put by Sokrates; which Gorgias himself confirms,
observing at the same time that no one had asked him any new question for many years past.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_4" href="#Footnotev2_24_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Sokrates accordingly asks
Gorgias what his profession is? what it is that he teaches? what is the definition of rhetoric? Not receiving a satisfactory answer, Sokrates furnishes a definition of his own: out of which grow two
arguments of wide ethical bearing: carried on by Sokrates, the first against Polus, the second against Kallikl&ecirc;s. Both these two are represented as voluble speakers, of confident temper,
regarding the acquisition of political power and oratorical celebrity as the grand objects of life. Polus had even composed a work on Rhetoric, of which we know nothing: but the tone of this dialogue
would seem to indicate (as far as we can judge from such evidence) that the style of the work was affected, and the temper of the author flippant.</p>

<p>Here, as in the other dialogues above noticed, the avowed aim of Sokrates is &mdash; first, to exclude long speaking &mdash; next, to get the question accurately conceived, and answered in an
appropriate manner. Specimens are given of unsuitable and inaccurate answers, which Sokrates corrects. The conditions of a good definition are made plain by contrast with bad ones; which either
include much more than the thing defined, or set forth what is accessory and occasional in place of what is essential and constant. These tentatives and gropings to find a definition are always
instructive, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page319" id="v2page319"></a>319</span>and must have been especially so in the Platonic age, when logical distinctions had never yet been made a subject

<p>About what is Rhetoric as a cognition concerned, Gorgias? <i>Gorg.</i> &mdash; About words or discourses. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; About what discourses? such as inform sick men how they are to get
well? <i>Gorg.</i> &mdash; No. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; It is not about all discourses? <i>Gorg.</i> &mdash; It makes men competent to speak: of course therefore also to think, upon the matters on which
they speak.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_5" href="#Footnotev2_24_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But the medical and gymnastic arts do this likewise, each with reference to its
respective subject: what then is the difference between them and Rhetoric? <i>Gorg.</i> &mdash; The difference is, that each of these other arts tends mainly towards some actual work or performance,
to which the discourses, when required at all, are subsidiary: but Rhetoric accomplishes every thing by discourses alone.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_6" href="#Footnotev2_24_6"><span class=
"sp">6</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But the same may be said about arithmetic, geometry, and other sciences. How are they distinguished from Rhetoric? You must tell me upon what matters the
discourses with which Rhetoric is conversant turn; just as you would tell me, if I asked the like question about arithmetic or astronomy. <i>Gorg.</i> &mdash; The discourses, with which Rhetoric is
conversant, turn upon the greatest of all human affairs. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; But this too, Gorgias, is indistinct and equivocal. Every man, the physician, the gymnast, the money-maker, thinks his
own object and his own affairs the greatest of all.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_7" href="#Footnotev2_24_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> <i>Gorg.</i> &mdash; The function of Rhetoric, is to persuade

<p>The Rhetor (says Gorgias) or accomplished public speaker, will give advice about all the matters that you name, and others besides. He will persuade the people and carry them along with him, even
against the opinion of the special <i>Expert</i>. He will talk more persuasively than the craftsman about matters of the craftsman&rsquo;s own business. The power of the Rhetor is thus very great:
but he ought to use it, like all other powers, for just and honest purposes; not to abuse it for wrong and oppression. If he does the latter, the misdeed is his own, and not the fault of his teacher,
who gave his lessons with a view that they should be turned to proper use. If a man, who has learnt the use of arms, employs them to commit murder, this abuse ought not to be imputed to his master of

<p>Polus now interferes and takes up the conversation: challenging Sokrates to furnish what <i>he</i> thinks the proper definition of Rhetoric. Sokrates obeys, in a tone of pungent polemic. Rhetoric
(he says) is no art at all, but an empirical knack of catering for the pleasure and favour of hearers; analogous to cookery.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_14" href="#Footnotev2_24_14"><span class=
"sp">14</span></a> It is a talent falling under the general aptitude called Flattery; possessed by some bold spirits, who are forward in divining and adapting themselves to the temper of the
public.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_15" href="#Footnotev2_24_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> It is not honourable, but a mean pursuit, like cookery. It is the shadow or false imitation of a branch of
the political art.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_16" href="#Footnotev2_24_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> In reference both to the body and the mind, there are two different conditions: one, a condition
really and truly <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page322" id="v2page322"></a>322</span>good &mdash; the other, good only in fallacious appearance, and not so in reality. To produce, and to verify,
the really good condition of the body, there are two specially qualified professions, the gymnast or trainer and the physician: in regard to the mind, the function of the trainer is performed by the
law-giving power, that of the physician by the judicial power. Law-making, and adjudicating, are both branches of the political art, and when put together make up the whole of it. Gymnastic and
medicine train and doctor the body towards its really best condition: law-making and adjudicating do the same in regard to the mind. To each of the four, there corresponds a sham counterpart or
mimic, a branch under the general head <i>flattery</i> &mdash; taking no account of what is really best, but only of that which is most agreeable for the moment, and by this trick recommending itself
to a fallacious esteem.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_17" href="#Footnotev2_24_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> Thus Cosmetic, or Ornamental Trickery, is the counterfeit of Gymnastic; and Cookery the
counterfeit of Medicine. Cookery studies only what is immediately agreeable to the body, without considering whether it be good or wholesome: and does this moreover, without any truly scientific
process of observation or inference, but simply by an empirical process of memory or analogy. But Medicine examines, and that too by scientific method, only what is good and wholesome for the body,
whether agreeable or not. Amidst ignorant men, Cookery slips in as the counterfeit of medicine; pretending to know what food is <i>good</i> for the body, while it really knows only what food is <i>
agreeable</i>. In like manner, the artifices of ornament dress up the body to a false appearance of that vigour and symmetry, which Gymnastics impart to it really and intrinsically.</p>

<p>The same analogies hold in regard to the mind. Sophistic is the shadow or counterfeit of law-giving: Rhetoric, of judging or adjudicating. The lawgiver and the judge aim at what is good for the
mind: the Sophist and the Rhetor aim at what is agreeable to it. This distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page323" id="v2page323"></a>323</span> between them (continues Sokrates) is true and
real: though it often happens that the Sophist is, both by himself and by others, confounded with and mistaken for the lawgiver, because he deals with the same topics and occurrences: and the Rhetor,
in the same manner, is confounded with the judge.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_18" href="#Footnotev2_24_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> The Sophist and the Rhetor, addressing themselves to the present

<p>It seems to me that the persons whom Plato here designates as being confounded together are, the Sophist with the lawgiver, the Rhetor with the judge or dikast; which is shown by the allusion,
three lines farther on, to the confusion between the cook and the physician. Heindorf supposes that the persons designated as being confounded are, the Sophist with the Rhetor; which I cannot think
to be the meaning of Plato.</p>

wish.</span></p>

<p>This is the definition given by Sokrates of Rhetoric and of the Rhetor. Polus then asks him: You say that Rhetoric is a branch of Flattery: Do you think that good Rhetors are considered as
flatterers in their respective cities? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; I do not think that<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_19" href="#Footnotev2_24_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> they are considered at all. <i>
Polus.</i> &mdash; How! not considered? Do not good Rhetors possess great power in their respective cities? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; No: if you understand the possession of power as a good thing for the
possessor. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; I do understand it so. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Then I say that the Rhetors possess nothing beyond the very minimum of power. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; How can that be? Do
not they, like despots, kill, impoverish, and expel any one whom they please? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; I admit that both Rhetors and Despots can do what seems good to themselves, and can bring penalties
of death, poverty, or exile upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page324" id="v2page324"></a>324</span>others: but I say that nevertheless they have no power, because they can do nothing which they

<p>The play on words here &mdash; for I see nothing else in it &mdash; can be expressed in English as well as in Greek. It has very little pertinence; because, as a matter of fact, the Rhetors
certainly had considerable importance, whether they deserved it or not. How little Plato cared to make his comparisons harmonise with the fact, may be seen by what immediately follows &mdash; where
he compares the Rhetors to Despots? and puts in the mouth of Polus the assertion that they kill or banish any one whom they choose.</p>

for them. If it be really not good, they do not do what they will, and therefore have no real power.</span></p>

<p>That which men wish (Sokrates lays down as a general proposition) is to obtain good, and to escape evil. Each separate act which they perform, is performed not with a view to its own special
result, but with a view to these constant and paramount ends. Good things, or profitable things (for Sokrates alternates the phrases as equivalent), are wisdom, health, wealth, and other such things.
Evil things are the contraries of these.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_21" href="#Footnotev2_24_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Many things are in themselves neither good nor evil, but may become one or
the other, according to circumstances &mdash; such as stones, wood, the acts of sitting still or moving, &amp;c. When we do any of these indifferent acts, it is with a view to the pursuit of good, or
to the avoidance of evil: we do not wish for the act, we wish for its good or profitable results. We do every thing for the sake of good: and if the results are really good or profitable, we
accomplish what we wish: if the contrary, not. Now, Despots and Rhetors, when they kill or banish or impoverish any one, do so because they think it will be better for them, or profitable.<a name=

<p>To do evil (continues Sokrates), is the worst thing that can happen to any one; the evil-doer is the most miserable and pitiable of men. The person who suffers evil is unfortunate, and is to be
pitied; but much less unfortunate and less to be pitied than the evil-doer. If I have a concealed dagger in the public market-place, I can kill any one whom I choose: but this is no good to me, nor
is it a proof of great power, because I shall be forthwith taken up and punished. The result is not profitable, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page325" id="v2page325"></a>325</span>but hurtful:
therefore the act is not good, nor is the power to do it either good or desirable.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_23" href="#Footnotev2_24_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> It is sometimes good to kill,

<p><i>Polus.</i> &mdash; A child can refute such doctrine. You have heard of Archelaus King of Macedonia. Is he, in your opinion, happy or miserable? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; I do not know: I have never
been in his society. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; Cannot you tell without that, whether he is happy or not? <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; No, certainly not. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; Then you will not call even the

that it does. I maintain that the good and honourable man or woman is happy: the unjust and wicked, miserable.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_25" href="#Footnotev2_24_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> <i>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_15" id="Sidenotev2_24_15"></a> Proof of the second point.</span></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now let us take the second point &mdash; Whether it be the greatest evil for the wrong-doer to be punished, or whether it be not a still greater evil for him to remain
unpunished. If punished, the wrong-doer is of course punished justly; and are not all just things fine or honourable, in so far as they are just? <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; I think so. <i>Sokr.</i>
&mdash; When a man does anything, must there not be some correlate which suffers; and must it not suffer in a way corresponding to what the doer does? Thus if any one strikes, there must also be
something stricken: and if he strikes quickly or violently, there must be something which is stricken quickly or violently. And so, if any one burns or cuts, there must be something burnt or cut. As
the agent acts, so the patient suffers. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; Yes. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now if a man be punished for wrong doing, he suffers what is just, and the punisher does what is just? <i>
Polus.</i> &mdash; He does. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; You admitted that all just things were honourable: therefore the agent does what is honourable, the patient suffers what is honourable.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_24_33" href="#Footnotev2_24_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> But if honourable, it must be either agreeable &mdash; <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page328" id="v2page328">
</a>328</span>or good and profitable. In this case, it is certainly not agreeable: it must therefore be good and profitable. The wrong-doer therefore, when punished, suffers what is good and is
profited. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; Yes.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_34" href="#Footnotev2_24_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; In what manner is he profited? It is, as I presume, by
becoming better in his mind &mdash; by being relieved from badness of mind. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; Probably. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Is not this badness of mind the greatest evil? In regard to wealth,
the special badness is poverty: in regard to the body, it is weakness, sickness, deformity, &amp;c.: in regard to the mind, it is ignorance, injustice, cowardice, &amp;c. Is not injustice, and other
badness of mind, the most disgraceful of the three? <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; Decidedly. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If it be most disgraceful, it must therefore be the worst. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; How? <i>
Sokr.</i> &mdash; It must (as we before agreed) have the greatest preponderance either of pain, or of hurt and evil. But the preponderance is not in pain: for no one will say that the being unjust
and intemperate and ignorant, is more painful than being poor and sick. The preponderance must therefore be great in hurt and evil. Mental badness is therefore a greater evil than either poverty, or
disease and bodily deformity. It is the greatest of human evils. <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; It appears so.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_35" href="#Footnotev2_24_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a></p>

<p><i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; The money-making art is, that which relieves us from poverty: the medical art, from sickness and weakness: the judicial or punitory, from injustice and wickedness of mind. Of
these three relieving forces, which is the most honourable? <i>Polus.</i> &mdash; The last, by far. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; If most honourable, it confers either most pleasure or most profit? <i>
Polus.</i> &mdash; Yes. <i>Sokr.</i> &mdash; Now, to go through medical treatment is not agreeable; but it answers to a man to undergo the pain, in order to get rid of a great evil, and to become
well. He would be a happier man, if he were never sick: he is less miserable by undergoing the painful treatment and becoming well, than if he underwent no treatment and remained sick. Just so the
man who is mentally bad: the happiest man is he who never becomes so; but if a man has become so, the next best course for him is, to undergo punishment and to get rid of the evil. The worst lot of
all is, that of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page329" id="v2page329"></a>329</span>him who remains mentally bad, without ever getting rid of badness.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_36" href=

<p>This last, Polus (continues Sokrates), is the condition of Archelaus, and of despots and Rhetors generally. They possess power which enables them, after they have committed injustice, to guard
themselves against being punished: which is just as if a sick man were to pride himself upon having taken precautions against being cured. They see the pain of the cure, but they are blind to the
profit of it; they are ignorant how much more miserable it is to have an unhealthy and unjust mind than an unhealthy body.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_37" href="#Footnotev2_24_37"><span class=

punishment upon them also.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_38" href="#Footnotev2_24_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a> On the other hand, as to our enemy, we ought undoubtedly to take precautions against
suffering any wrong from him ourselves: but if he has done wrong to others, we ought to do all we can, by word or deed, not to bring him to punishment, but to prevent him from suffering punishment or
making compensation: so that he may live as long as possible in impunity.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_39" href="#Footnotev2_24_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> These are the purposes towards which

<p>This dialogue between Sokrates and Polus exhibits a representation<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page330" id="v2page330"></a>330</span> of Platonic Ethics longer and more continuous than is
usual in the dialogues. I have therefore given a tolerably copious abridgment of it, and shall now proceed to comment upon its reasoning.</p>

<p>The whole tenor of its assumptions, as well as the conclusions in which it ends, are so repugnant to received opinions, that Polus, even while compelled to assent, treats it as a paradox: while
Kallikles, who now takes up the argument, begins by asking from Ch&aelig;rephon &mdash; &ldquo;Is Sokrates really in earnest, or is he only jesting?&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_41" href=

in so far as it involves an appeal to the judgment of the public as a matter of fact. Plato follows out the train of reasoning &mdash; which at the time presents itself to his mind as conclusive, or
at least as plausible &mdash; whether he may agree or disagree with others.</p>

<p>Plato has ranked the Rhetor in the same category as the Despot: a classification upon which I shall say something presently. But throughout the part of the dialogue just extracted, he treats the
original question about Rhetoric as part of a much larger ethical question.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_43" href="#Footnotev2_24_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> Every one (argues Sokrates) wishes for
the attainment of good and for the avoidance of evil. Every one performs each separate act with a view not to its own immediate end, but to one or other of these permanent ends. In so far as he
attains them, he is happy: in so far as he either fails in attaining the good, or incurs the evil, he is unhappy or miserable. The good and honourable man or woman is happy, the unjust and wicked is
miserable. Power acquired or employed unjustly, is no boon to the possessor: for he does not thereby obtain what he really wishes, good or happiness; but incurs the contrary, evil <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page331" id="v2page331"></a>331</span>and misery. The man who does wrong is more miserable than he who suffers wrong: but the most miserable of all is he who does wrong and then

257-347), alludes to the same thesis as this here advanced by Plato, treating it as one which all men of sense would reject, and which none but a few men pretending to be wise would proclaim &mdash;

<p>In this last phrase Isokrates probably has Plato in his mind, though without pronouncing the name.</p>
</div>

<p>Polus, on the other hand, contends, that Archelaus, who has &ldquo;waded through slaughter&rdquo; to the throne of Macedonia, is a happy man both in his own feelings and in those of every one
else, envied and admired by the world generally: That to say &mdash; Archelaus would have been more happy, or less miserable, if he had failed in his enterprise and had been put to death under cruel
torture &mdash; is an untenable paradox.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_20" id="Sidenotev2_24_20"></a> Peculiar view taken by Plato of Good &mdash; Evil &mdash; Happiness.</span></p>

<p>The issue here turns, and the force of Plato&rsquo;s argument rests (assuming Sokrates to speak the real sentiments of Plato), upon the peculiar sense which he gives to the words Good &mdash; Evil
&mdash; Happiness:&mdash;different from the sense in which they are conceived by mankind generally, and which is here followed by Polus. It is possible that to minds like Sokrates and Plato, the idea
of themselves committing enormous crimes for ambitious purposes might be the most intolerable of all ideas, worse to contemplate than any amount of suffering: moreover, that if they could conceive
themselves as having been thus guilty, the sequel the least intolerable for them to imagine would be one of expiatory pain. This, taken as the personal sentiment of Plato, admits of no reply. But
when he attempts to convert this subjective judgment into an objective conclusion binding on all, he fails of success, and misleads himself by equivocal language.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_21" id="Sidenotev2_24_21"></a> Contrast of the usual meaning of these words, with the Platonic meaning.</span></p>

<p>Plato distinguishes two general objects of human desire, and two of human aversion. 1. The immediate, and generally transient, object &mdash; Pleasure or the Pleasurable &mdash; Pain or the
Painful. 2. The distant, ulterior, and more permanent object &mdash; Good or the profitable &mdash; Evil or the hurtful. &mdash; In the attainment of Good and avoidance of Evil consists happiness.
But now comes the important question &mdash; In what sense are we to understand the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page332" id="v2page332"></a>332</span>words Good and Evil? What did Plato mean by
them? Did he mean the same as mankind generally? Have mankind generally one uniform meaning? In answer to this question, we must say, that neither Plato, nor mankind generally, are consistent or
unanimous in their use of the words: and that Plato sometimes approximates to, sometimes diverges from, the more usual meaning. Plato does not here tell us clearly what he himself means by Good and
Evil: he specifies no objective or external mark by which we may know it: we learn only, that Good is a mental perfection &mdash; Evil a mental taint &mdash; answering to indescribable but
characteristic sentiments in Plato&rsquo;s own mind, and only negatively determined by this circumstance &mdash; That they have no reference either to pleasure or pain. In the vulgar sense, Good
stands distinguished from pleasure (or relief from pain), and Evil from pain (or loss of pleasure), as the remote, the causal, the lasting from the present, the product, the transient. Good and Evil
are explained by enumerating all the things so called, of which enumeration Plato gives a partial specimen in this dialogue: elsewhere he dwells upon what he calls the Idea of Good, of which I shall
speak more fully hereafter. Having said that all men aim at good, he gives, as examples of good things &mdash; Wisdom, Health, Wealth, and other such things: while the contrary of these, Stupidity,
Sickness, Poverty, are evil things: the list of course might be much enlarged. Taking Good and Evil generally to denote the common property of each of these lists, it is true that men perform a large
portion of their acts with a view to attain the former and avoid the latter:&mdash;that the approach which they make to happiness depends, speaking generally, upon the success which attends their
exertions for the attainment of and avoidance of these permanent ends: and moreover that these ends have their ultimate reference to each man&rsquo;s own feelings.</p>

<p>But this meaning of Good is no longer preserved, when Sokrates proceeds to prove that the triumphant usurper Archelaus is the most miserable of men, and that to do wrong with impunity is the
greatest of all evils.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_22" id="Sidenotev2_24_22"></a> Examination of the proof given by Sokrates &mdash; Inconsistency between the general answer of Polus and his previous
declarations &mdash; Law and Nature.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates provides a basis for his intended proof by asking Polus,<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_45" href="#Footnotev2_24_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> which of the two is most disgraceful &mdash; To
do wrong &mdash; or to suffer wrong? Polus answers &mdash; To do <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page333" id="v2page333"></a>333</span>wrong: and this answer is inconsistent with what he had
previously said about Archelaus. That prince, though a wrong-doer on the largest scale, has been declared by Polus to be an object of his supreme envy and admiration: while Sokrates also admits that
this is the sentiment of almost all mankind, except himself. To be consistent with such an assertion, Polus ought to have answered the contrary of what he does answer, when the general question is
afterwards put to him: or at least he ought to have said &mdash; &ldquo;Sometimes the one, sometimes the other&rdquo;. But this he is ashamed to do, as we shall find Kallikles intimating at a
subsequent stage of the dialogue:<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_46" href="#Footnotev2_24_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> because of King Nomos, or the established habit of the community &mdash; who feel
that society rests upon a sentiment of reciprocal right and obligation animating every one, and require that violations of that sentiment shall be marked with censure in general words, however widely
the critical feeling may depart from such censure in particular cases.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_47" href="#Footnotev2_24_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> Polus is forced to make profession of a <span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page334" id="v2page334"></a>334</span>faith, which neither he nor others (except Sokrates with a few companions) universally or consistently apply. To bring such a force to
bear upon the opponent, was one of the known artifices of dialecticians:<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_48" href="#Footnotev2_24_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> and Sokrates makes it his point of
departure, to prove the unparalleled misery of Archelaus.</p>

chapter (pp. 99-101) of Adam Smith&rsquo;s Theory of Moral Sentiments, entitled, &ldquo;Of the corruption of our moral sentiments, which is occasioned by the disposition to admire the rich and great,
and to neglect or despise persons of poor and mean condition&rdquo;. He says &mdash; &ldquo;The disposition to admire and almost to worship the rich and the powerful, and to despise, or at least to
neglect, persons of poor and mean condition, though necessary both to establish and maintain the distinction of ranks and the order of society, is, at the same time, the great and most universal
cause of the corruption of our moral sentiments.&hellip; They are the wise and the virtuous chiefly &mdash; a select, though I am afraid, a small party &mdash; who are the real and steady admirers of
wisdom and virtue. The great mob of mankind are the admirers and worshippers &mdash; and what may seem more extraordinary, most frequently the disinterested admirers and worshippers &mdash; of wealth
and greatness.&hellip;. It is scarce <i>agreeable to good morals</i>, or even to good language, perhaps, to say that mere wealth and greatness, abstracted from merit and virtue, deserve our respect.
We must acknowledge, however, that they <i>almost constantly obtain it</i>: and <i>that they may therefore in a certain sense be considered as the natural objects of it</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Archelaus is a most conspicuous example of this disposition of the mass of mankind to worship and admire, disinterestedly, power and greatness: and the language used by Adam Smith in the last
sentence illustrates the conversation of Sokrates, Polus, and Kallikl&ecirc;s. Adam Smith admits that energetic proceedings, ending in great power, such as those of Archelaus, obtain honour and
worship from the vast majority of disinterested spectators: and that, therefore they are in a certain sense the <i>natural objects</i> of such a sentiment (&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048;
&phi;&#973;&sigma;&iota;&nu;). But if the question be put to him, Whether such proceedings, with such a position, are <i>worthy of honour</i>, he is constrained by good morals
(&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8048; &nu;&#972;&mu;&omicron;&nu;) to reply in the negative. It is true that Adam Smith numbers himself with the small minority, while Polus shares the opinion of the large
majority. But what is required by King Nomos must be professed even by dissentients, unless they possess the unbending resolution of Sokrates.</p>

<p>He proceeds to define Pulchrum and Turpe (&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#8056;&nu;-&alpha;&#7984;&sigma;&chi;&rho;&#972;&nu;). When we recollect the Hippias Major, in which dialogue many definitions of
Pulchrum were canvassed and all rejected, so that the search ended in total disappointment &mdash; we are surprised to see that Sokrates hits off at once a definition satisfactory both to himself and
Polus: and we are the more surprised, because the definition here admitted without a remark, is in substance one of those shown to be untenable in the Hippias Major.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_49" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> It depends upon the actual argumentative purpose which Plato has in hand, whether he chooses to multiply objections and give them effect &mdash; or
to ignore them altogether. But the definition which he here proposes, even if assumed as incontestable, fails altogether to sustain the conclusion that he draws from it. He defines Pulchrum to be
that which either confers pleasure upon the spectator when he contemplates it, or produces ulterior profit or good &mdash; we must presume profit to the spectator, or to him along with others &mdash;
at any rate it is not said <i>to whom</i>. He next defines the ugly and disgraceful (&tau;&#8056; &alpha;&#7984;&sigma;&chi;&rho;&#8056;&nu;) as comprehending both the painful and the hurtful or
evil. If then (he argues) to do wrong is more ugly and disgraceful than to suffer wrong, this must be either because it is more painful &mdash; or because it is more hurtful, more evil (worse). It
certainly is not more painful: therefore it must be worse.</p>

his inference, the definition would be inadmissible.</span></p>

<p>But worse, for whom? For the spectators, who declare the proceedings of Archelaus to be disgraceful? For the persons who suffer by his proceedings? Or for Archelaus himself? It is the last of the
three which Sokrates undertakes to prove: but his definition does <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page335" id="v2page335"></a>335</span>not help him to the proof. Turpe is defined to be either what
causes immediate pain to the spectator, or ulterior hurt &mdash; to whom? If we say to the spectator &mdash; the definition will not serve as a ground of inference to the condition of the agent
contemplated. If on the other hand, we say &mdash; to the agent &mdash; the definition so understood becomes inadmissible: as well for other reasons, as because there are a great many Turpia which
are not agents at all, and which the definition therefore would not include. Either therefore the definition given by Sokrates is a bad one &mdash; or it will not sustain his conclusion. And thus, on
this very important argument, where Sokrates admits that he stands alone, and where therefore the proof would need to be doubly cogent &mdash; an argument too where the great cause (so Adam Smith
terms it) of the corruption of men&rsquo;s moral sentiments has to be combated &mdash; Sokrates has nothing to produce except premisses alike far-fetched and irrelevant. What increases our regret is,
that the real arguments establishing the turpitude of Archelaus and his acts are obvious enough, if you look for them in the right direction. You discover nothing while your eye is fixed on Archelaus
himself: far from presenting any indications of misery, which Sokrates professes to discover, he has gained much of what men admire as good wherever they see it. But when you turn to the persons whom
he has killed, banished, or ruined &mdash; to the mass of suffering which he has inflicted &mdash; and to the widespread insecurity which such acts of successful iniquity spread through all societies
where they become known &mdash; there is no lack of argument to justify that sentiment which prompts a reflecting spectator to brand him as a disgraceful man. This argument however is here altogether
neglected by Plato. Here, as elsewhere, he looks only at the self-regarding side of Ethics.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_25" id="Sidenotev2_24_25"></a> Plato applies to every one a standard of happiness and misery peculiar to himself. His view about the conduct of
Archelaus is just, but he does not give the true reasons for it.</span></p>

<p>Sokrates proceeds next to prove &mdash; That the wrong-doer who remains unpunished is more miserable than if he were punished. The wrong-doer (he argues) when punished suffers what is just: but
all just things are honourable: therefore he suffers what is honourable. But all honourable things are so called because they are either agreeable, or profitable, or both together. Punishment is
certainly not agreeable: it must <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page336" id="v2page336"></a>336</span>therefore be profitable or good. Accordingly the wrong-doer when justly punished suffers what
is profitable or good. He is benefited, by being relieved of mental evil or wickedness, which is a worse evil than either bodily sickness or poverty. In proportion to the magnitude of this evil, is
the value of the relief which removes it, and the superior misery of the unpunished wrong-doer who continues to live under it.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_50" href="#Footnotev2_24_50"><span class=

</div>

<p>Upon this argument, I make the same remark as upon that immediately preceding. We are not expressly told, whether good, evil, happiness, misery, &amp;c., refer to the agent alone or to others also:
but the general tenor implies that the agent alone is meant. And in this sense, Plato does not make out his case. He establishes an arbitrary standard of his own, recognised only by a few followers,
and altogether differing from the ordinary standard, to test and compare happiness and misery. The successful criminal, Archelaus himself, far from feeling any such intense misery as Plato describes,
is satisfied and proud of his position, which most others also account an object of envy. This is not disputed by Plato himself. And in the face of this fact, it is fruitless as well as illogical to
attempt to prove, by an elaborate process of deductive reasoning, that Archelaus <i>must</i> be miserable. That step of Plato&rsquo;s reasoning, in which he asserts, that the wrong-doer when justly
punished suffers what is profitable or good &mdash; is only true if you take in (what Plato omits to mention) the interests of society as well as those of the agent. His punishment is certainly
profitable to (conducive to the security and well being of) society: it may possibly be also profitable to himself, but very frequently it is not so. The conclusion brought out by Plato, therefore,
while contradicted by the fact, involves also a fallacy in the reasoning process.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_26" id="Sidenotev2_24_26"></a> If the reasoning of Plato were true, the point of view in which punishment is considered would be reversed.</span></p>

<p>Throughout the whole of this dialogue, Plato intimates decidedly how great a paradox the doctrine maintained by Sokrates must appear: how diametrically it was opposed to the opinion not merely of
the less informed multitude, but of the wiser and more reflecting citizen &mdash; even such a man as Nikias. Indeed it is literally <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page337" id="v2page337">
</a>337</span>exact &mdash; what Plato here puts into the mouth of Kallikles &mdash; that if the doctrine here advocated by Sokrates were true, the whole of social life would be turned upside down.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_24_51" href="#Footnotev2_24_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a> If, for example, it were true, as Plato contends, &mdash; That every man who commits a crime, takes upon him thereby a
terrible and lasting distemper, incurable except by the application of punishment, which is the specific remedy in the case &mdash; every theory of punishment would, literally speaking, be turned
upside down. The great discouragement from crime would then consist in the fear of that formidable distemper with which the criminal was sure to inoculate himself: and punishment, instead of being
(as it is now considered, and as Plato himself represents it in the Protagoras) the great discouragement to the commission of crime, would operate in the contrary direction. It would be the means of
removing or impairing the great real discouragement to crime: and a wise legislator would hesitate to inflict it. This would be nothing less than a reversal of the most universally accepted political
or social precepts (as Kallikles is made to express himself).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_27" id="Sidenotev2_24_27"></a> Plato pushes too far the analogy between mental distemper and bodily distemper &mdash; Material difference between the
two &mdash; Distemper must be felt by the distempered persons.</span></p>

<p>It will indeed be at once seen, that the taint or distemper with which Archelaus is supposed to inoculate himself, when he commits signal crime &mdash; is a pure fancy or poetical metaphor on the
part of Plato himself.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_52" href="#Footnotev2_24_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> A distemper must imply something painful, enfeebling, disabling, to the individual who feels
it: there is no other meaning: we cannot recognise a distemper, which does not make itself felt in any way by the distempered person. Plato is misled by his ever-repeated analogy between bodily
health and mental health: real, on some points &mdash; not real on others. When a man is in bad bodily health, his sensations warn him of it at once. He suffers pain, discomfort, <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page338" id="v2page338"></a>338</span>or disabilities, which leave no doubt as to the fact: though he may not know either the precise cause, or the appropriate remedy.
Conversely, in the absence of any such warnings, and in the presence of certain positive sensations, he knows himself to be in tolerable or good health. If Sokrates and Archelaus were both in good
bodily health, or both in bad bodily health, each would be made aware of the fact by analogous evidences. But by what measure are we to determine <i>when</i> a man is in a good or bad mental state?
By his own feelings? In that case, Archelaus and Sokrates are in a mental state equally good: each is satisfied with his own. By the judgment of by-standers? Archelaus will then be the better of the
two: at least his admirers and enviers will outnumber those of Sokrates. By my judgment? If my opinion is asked, I agree with Sokrates: though not on the grounds which he here urges, but on other
grounds. Who is to be the ultimate referee &mdash; the interests or security of other persons, who have suffered or are likely to suffer by Archelaus, being by the supposition left out of view?</p>

<p>Polus is now dismissed as vanquished, after having been forced, against his will, to concede &mdash; That the doer of wrong is more miserable than the sufferer: That he is more miserable, if
unpunished, &mdash; less so, if punished: That a triumphant criminal on a great scale, like Archelaus, is the most miserable of men.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_28" id="Sidenotev2_24_28"></a> Kallikles begins to argue against Sokrates &mdash; he takes a distinction between Just by Law and Just by nature
&mdash; Reply of Sokrates, that there is no variance between the two, properly understood.</span></p>

<p>Here, then, we commence with Kallikles: who interposes, to take up the debate with Sokrates. Polus (says Kallikles), from deference to the opinions of mankind, has erroneously conceded the point
&mdash; That it is more disgraceful to do wrong, than to suffer wrong. This is indeed true (continues Kallikles), according to what is just by law or convention, that is, according to the general
sentiment of mankind: but it is not true, according to justice by nature, or natural justice. Nature and Law are here opposed.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_53" href="#Footnotev2_24_53"><span class=
"sp">53</span></a> The justice of Nature is, that among men (as among other animals) the strong individual should govern and strip the weak, taking and keeping as much as he can <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page339" id="v2page339"></a>339</span>grasp. But this justice will not suit the weak, who are the many, and who defeat it by establishing a different justice &mdash; justice
according to law &mdash; to curb the strong man, and prevent him from having more than his fair share.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_54" href="#Footnotev2_24_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a> The many,
feeling their own weakness, and thankful if they can only secure a fair and equal division, make laws and turn the current of praise and blame for their own protection, in order to deter the strong
man from that encroachment and oppression to which he is disposed. <i>The just according to law</i> is thus a tutelary institution, established by the weak to defend themselves against <i>the just
according to nature</i>. Nature measures right by might, and by nothing else: so that according to the right of nature, suffering wrong is more disgraceful than doing wrong. H&ecirc;rakl&ecirc;s
takes from Geryon his cattle, by the right of nature or of the strongest, without either sale or gift.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_55" href="#Footnotev2_24_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_29" id="Sidenotev2_24_29"></a> What Kallikl&ecirc;s says is not to be taken as a sample of the teachings of Athenian sophists. Kallikl&ecirc;s &mdash;
rhetor and politician.</span></p>

<p>Several commentators have contended, that the doctrine which Plato here puts into the mouth of Kallikl&ecirc;s was taught by the Sophists at Athens: who are said to have inculcated on their
hearers that true wisdom and morality consisted in acting upon the right of the strongest and taking whatever they could get, without any regard to law or justice. I have already <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page340" id="v2page340"></a>340</span>endeavoured to show, in my History of Greece, that the Sophists cannot be shown to have taught either this doctrine, or any other common
doctrine: that one at least among them (Prodikus) taught a doctrine inconsistent with it: and that while all of them agreed in trying to impart rhetorical accomplishments, or the power of handling
political, ethical, judicial, matters in a manner suitable for the Athenian public &mdash; each had his own way of doing this. Kallikl&ecirc;s is not presented by Plato as a Sophist, but as a Rhetor
aspiring to active political influence; and taking a small dose of philosophy, among the preparations for that end.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_57" href="#Footnotev2_24_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a>
He depreciates the Sophists as much as the philosophers, and in fact rather more.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_58" href="#Footnotev2_24_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> Moreover Plato represents him as
adapting himself, with accommodating subservience, to the Athenian public assembly, and saying or unsaying exactly as they manifested their opinion.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_59" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> Now the Athenian public assembly would repudiate indignantly all this pretended right of the strongest, if any orator thought fit to put it forward
as over-ruling established right and law. Any aspiring or subservient orator, such as Kallikl&ecirc;s is described, would know better than to address them in this strain. The language which Plato
puts into the mouth of Kallikl&ecirc;s is noway consistent with the attribute which he also ascribes to him &mdash; slavish deference to the judgments of the Athenian D&ecirc;mos.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_30" id="Sidenotev2_24_30"></a> Uncertainty of referring to Nature as an authority. It may be pleaded in favour of opposite theories. The theory of
Kallikl&ecirc;s is made to appear repulsive by the language in which he expresses it.</span></p>

<p>Kallikl&ecirc;s is made to speak like one who sympathises with the right of the strongest, and who decorates such iniquity with the name and authority of that which he calls Nature. But this only
shows the uncertainty of referring to Nature as an authority.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_60" href="#Footnotev2_24_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> It may be pleaded in favour of different and opposite
theories. Nature prompts the strong man to take from weaker men what will gratify his desires: Nature also prompts these weaker men to defeat him and protect themselves by the best means in their
power. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page341" id="v2page341"></a>341</span>many are weaker, taken individually &mdash; stronger taken collectively: hence they resort to defensive combination,
established rules, and collective authority.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_61" href="#Footnotev2_24_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> The right created on one side, and the opposite right created on the
other, flow alike from Nature: that is, from propensities and principles natural, and deeply seated, in the human mind. The authority of Nature, considered as an enunciation of actual and wide-spread
facts, may be pleaded for both alike. But a man&rsquo;s sympathy and approbation may go either with the one or the other; and he may choose to stamp that which he approves, with the name of Nature as
a personified law-maker. This is what is here done by Kallikl&ecirc;s as Plato exhibits him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_62" href="#Footnotev2_24_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> He <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page342" id="v2page342"></a>342</span>sympathises with, and approves, the powerful individual. Now the greater portion of mankind are, and always have been, governed upon this
despotic principle, and brought up to respect it: while many, even of those who dislike Kallikl&ecirc;s because <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page343" id="v2page343"></a>343</span>they regard him
as the representative of Athenian democracy (to which however his proclaimed sentiments stand pointedly opposed), when they come across a great man or so-called hero, such as Alexander or Napoleon,
applaud the most exorbitant ambition if successful, and if accompanied by military genius and energy &mdash; regarding communities as made for little else except to serve as his instruments,
subjects, and worshippers. Such are represented as the sympathies of Kallikl&ecirc;s: but those of the Athenians went with the second of the two rights &mdash; and mine go with it also. And though
the language which Plato puts into the mouth of Kallikl&ecirc;s, in describing this second right, abounds in contemptuous rhetoric, proclaiming offensively the individual weakness of the multitude<a
name="FnAnchorv2_24_63" href="#Footnotev2_24_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> &mdash; yet this very fact is at once the most solid and most respectable foundation on which rights and obligations
can be based. The establishment of them is indispensable, and is felt as indispensable, to procure security for the community: whereby the strong man whom Kallikl&ecirc;s extols as the favourite of
Nature, may be tamed by discipline and censure, so as to accommodate his own behaviour to this equitable arrangement.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_64" href="#Footnotev2_24_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
Plato himself, in his Republic,<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_65" href="#Footnotev2_24_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> traces the generation of a city to the fact that each man individually taken is not
self-sufficing, but stands in need of many things: it is no less true, that each man stands also in fear of many things, especially of depredations from animals, and depredations from powerful
individuals of his own species. In the mythe of Protagoras,<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_66" href="#Footnotev2_24_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> we have fears from hostile animals &mdash; in the speech
here ascribed to Kallikl&ecirc;s, we have fears from hostile strong men &mdash; assigned as the generating cause, both of political communion and of established rights and obligations to protect
it.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_24_62" id="Footnotev2_24_62"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_24_62">62</a></span> Respecting the vague and indeterminate phrases &mdash; Natural
Justice, Natural Right, Law of Nature &mdash; see Mr. Austin&rsquo;s Province of Jurisprudence Determined, p. 160, ed. 2nd. [Jurisp., 4th ed, pp. 179, 591-2], and Sir H. S. Maine&rsquo;s Ancient Law,
chapters iii. and iv.</p>

<p>Among the assertions made about the Athenian Sophists, it is said by some commentators that they denied altogether any Just or Unjust by <i>nature</i> &mdash; that they recognised no Just or
Unjust, except by <i>law or convention</i>.</p>

<p>To say that the <i>Sophists</i> (speaking of them collectively) either affirmed or denied anything, is, in my judgment, incorrect. Certain persons are alluded to by Plato (The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. 172
B) as adopting partially the doctrine of Protagoras (<i>Homo Mensura</i>) and as denying altogether the Just by <i>nature</i>.</p>

<p>In another Platonic passage (Protagor. 337) which is also cited as contributing to prove that the Sophists denied &tau;&#8056; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu;
&phi;&#973;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota; &mdash; nothing at all is said about &tau;&#8056; &delta;&#943;&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu;. Hippias the Sophist is there introduced as endeavouring to appease
the angry feeling between Protagoras and Sokrates by reminding them, &ldquo;I am of opinion that we all (<i>i.e.</i> men of literature and study) are kinsmen, friends, and fellow-citizens by <i>
nature</i> though not by <i>law</i>: for law, the despot of mankind, carries many things by force, contrary to nature&rdquo;. The remark is very appropriate from one who is trying to restore good
feeling between literary disputants: and the cosmopolitan character of literature is now so familiar a theme, that I am surprised to find Heindorf (in his note) making it an occasion for throwing the
usual censure upon the Sophist, because some of them distinguished Nature from the Laws, and despised the latter in comparison with the former.</p>

<p>Kallikl&ecirc;s here, in the Gorgias, maintains an opinion not only different from, but inconsistent with, the opinion alluded to above in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, 172 B. The persons noticed in
the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus said &mdash; There is no Natural Justice: no Justice, except Justice by Law. Kallikl&ecirc;s says &mdash; There is a Natural Justice quite distinct from (and which he
esteems more than) Justice by Law: he then explains what he believes Natural Justice to be &mdash; That the strong man should take what he pleases from the weak.</p>

<p>Though these two opinions are really inconsistent with each other, yet we see Plato in the Leges (x. 889 E, 890 A) alluding to them both as the same creed, held and defended by the same men; whom
he denounces with extreme acrimony. Who they were, he does not name; he does not mention &sigma;&omicron;&phi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&#943;, but calls them &#7936;&nu;&delta;&rho;&#8182;&nu;
&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&#8182;&nu;, &#7984;&delta;&iota;&omega;&tau;&#8182;&nu; &tau;&epsilon; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&#8182;&nu;.</p>

<p>We see, in the third chapter of Sir H. S. Maine&rsquo;s excellent work on Ancient Law, the meaning of these phrases &mdash; Natural Justice, Law of Nature. It designated or included &ldquo;a set
of legal principles entitled to supersede the existing laws, on the ground of intrinsic superiority&rdquo;. It denoted an ideal condition of society, supposed to be much better than what actually
prevailed. This at least seems to have been the meaning which began to attach to it in the time of Plato and Aristotle. What this ideal perfection of human society was, varied in the minds of
different speakers. In each speaker&rsquo;s mind the word and sentiment was much the same, though the objects to which it attached were often different. Empedokles proclaims in solemn and emphatic
language that the Law of Nature peremptorily forbids us to kill any animal. (Aristot. Rhetor. i. 13, 1373 b. 15.) Plato makes out to his own satisfaction, that his Republic is thoroughly in harmony
with the Law of Nature: and he insists especially on this harmony, in the very point which even the Platonic critics admit to be wrong &mdash; that is, in regard to the training of women and the
relations of the sexes (Republic, v. 456 C, 466 D). We learn from Plato himself that the propositions of the Republic were thoroughly adverse to what other persons reverenced as the Law of
Nature.</p>

<p>In the notes of Beck and Heindorf on Protagor. p. 337 we read, &ldquo;Hippias pr&aelig; c&aelig;teris Sophistis contempsit leges, iisque opposuit Naturam. Naturam legibus plures cert&eacute;
Sophistarum opposuisse, easque pr&aelig; ill&acirc; contempsisse, multis veterum locis constat.&rdquo; Now this allegation is more applicable to Plato than to the Sophists. Plato speaks with the most
unmeasured contempt of existing communities and their laws: the scheme of his Republic, radically departing from them as it does, shows what he considered as required by the exigencies of human
nature. Both the Stoics and the Epikureans extolled what they called the Law of Nature above any laws actually existing.</p>

<p>The other charge made against the Sophists (quite opposite, yet sometimes advanced by the same critics) is, that they recognised no Just by Nature, but only Just by Law: <i>i.e.</i> all the actual
laws and customs considered as binding in each different community. This is what Plato ascribes to some persons (Sophists or not) in the The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus, p. 172. But in this sense it is not
exact to call Kallikl&ecirc;s (as Heindorf does, Protagor. p. 337) &ldquo;germanus ille Sophistarum alumnus in Gorgi&agrave; Callicles,&rdquo; nor to affirm (with Schleiermacher, Einleit. zum
The&aelig;t&ecirc;t. p. 183) that Plato meant to refute Aristippus under the name of Kallikles, Aristippus maintaining that there was no Just by Nature, but only Just by Law or Convention.</p>

necessity. The right of nature authorises them to have the largest desires, since their courage and ability furnish means to satisfy the desires. It would be silly if a king&rsquo;s son or a despot
were to limit himself to the same measure of enjoyment with which a poor citizen must be content; and worse than silly if he did not enrich his friends in preference to his enemies. He need not care
for that public law and censure which must reign paramount over each man among the many. A full swing of enjoyment, if a man has power to procure and maintain it, is virtue as well as happiness.<a

<p>Upon this question the discussion now turns: whether pleasure and good are the same, or whether there are not some pleasures good, others bad. By a string of questions much protracted, but subtle

every man who is competent to distinguish what pleasures are good, and what are bad. A scientific and skilful adviser, judging upon general principles, is required to make this distinction.<a name=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_34" id="Sidenotev2_24_34"></a> Contradiction between Sokrates in the Gorgias, and Sokrates in the Protagoras.</span></p>

<p>This debate between Sokrates and Kallikl&ecirc;s, respecting the &ldquo;Quomodo vivendum est,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_74" href="#Footnotev2_24_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> deserves
attention on more than one account. In the first place, the relation which Sokrates is here made to declare between the two pairs of general terms, Pleasurable &mdash; Good: Painful &mdash; Evil: is
the direct reverse of that which he both declares and demonstrates in the Protagoras. In that dialogue, the Sophist Protagoras is represented as holding an opinion very like that which is maintained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page346" id="v2page346"></a>346</span>by Sokrates in the Gorgias. But Sokrates (in the Protagoras) refutes him by an elaborate argument; and demonstrates that
pleasure and good (also pain and evil) are names for the same fundamental ideas under different circumstances: pleasurable and painful referring only to the sensation of the present moment &mdash;
while good and evil include, besides, an estimate of its future consequences and accompaniments, both pleasurable and painful, and represent the result of such calculation. In the Gorgias, Sokrates
demonstrates the contrary, by an argument equally elaborate but not equally convincing. He impugns a doctrine advocated by Kallikl&ecirc;s, and in impugning it, proclaims a marked antithesis and even
repugnance between the pleasurable and the good, the painful and the evil: rejecting the fundamental identity of the two, which he advocates in the Protagoras, as if it were a disgraceful heresy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_35" id="Sidenotev2_24_35"></a> Views of critics about this contradiction.</span></p>

<p>The subject evidently presented itself to Plato in two different ways at different times. Which of the two is earliest, we have no means of deciding. The commentators, who favour generally the
view taken in the Gorgias, treat the Protagoras as a juvenile and erroneous production: sometimes, with still less reason, they represent Sokrates as arguing in that dialogue, from the principles of
his opponents, not from his own. For my part, without knowing whether the Protagoras or the Gorgias is the earliest, I think the Protagoras an equally finished composition, and I consider that the
views which Sokrates is made to propound in it, respecting pleasure and good, are decidedly nearer to the truth.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_36" id="Sidenotev2_24_36"></a> Comparison and appreciation of the reasoning of Sokrates in both dialogues.</span></p>

<p>That in the list of pleasures there are some which it is proper to avoid, &mdash; and in the list of pains, some which it is proper to accept or invite &mdash; is a doctrine maintained by Sokrates
alike in both the dialogues. Why? Because some pleasures are good, others bad: some pains bad, others good &mdash; says Sokrates in the Gorgias. The same too is said by Sokrates in the Protagoras;
but then, he there explains what he means by the appellation. All pleasure (he there says), so far as it goes, is good &mdash; all pain is bad. But there are some pleasures which cannot be enjoyed
without debarring us from greater pleasures or entailing upon us greater pains: on that ground therefore, such pleasures are bad. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page347" id="v2page347">
</a>347</span>So again, there are some pains, the suffering of which is a condition indispensable to our escaping greater pains, or to our enjoying greater pleasures: such pains therefore are good.
Thus this apparent exception does not really contradict, but confirms, the general doctrine &mdash; That there is no good but the pleasurable, and the elimination of pain &mdash; and no evil except
the painful, or the privation of pleasure. Good and evil have no reference except to pleasures and pains; but the terms imply, in each particular case, an estimate and comparison of future
pleasurable and painful consequences, and express the result of such comparison. &ldquo;You call enjoyment itself evil&rdquo; (says Sokrates in the Protagoras),<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_75" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> &ldquo;when it deprives us of greater pleasures or entails upon us greater pains. If you have any other ground, or look to any other end, in calling
it evil, you may tell us what that end is; but you will not be able to tell us. So too, you say that pain is a good, when it relieves us from greater pains, or when it is necessary as the antecedent
cause of greater pleasures. If you have any other end in view, when you call pain good, you may tell us what that end is; but you will not be able to tell us.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_76" href=

in the Protagoras &mdash; &ldquo;If you make such a distinction, explain the ground on which you make it, and the end to which you look&ldquo;. The distinction in the Gorgias stands without any

problem set to the scientific man is one of which all the quantities are unknown. Now Sokrates in the Protagoras<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_78" href="#Footnotev2_24_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> also
lays it down, that a scientific or rational calculation must be had, and a mind competent to such calculation must be postulated, to decide which pleasures are bad or fit to be rejected &mdash; which
pains are good, or proper to be endured. But then he clearly specifies the elements which alone are to be taken into the calculation &mdash; <i>viz.</i>, the future pleasures and pains accompanying
or dependent upon each with the estimate of their comparative magnitude and durability. The theory of this calculation is clear and intelligible: though in many particular cases, the data necessary
for making it, and the means of comparing them, may be very imperfectly accessible.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_38" id="Sidenotev2_24_38"></a> Modern ethical theories. Intuition. Moral sense &mdash; not recognised by Plato in either of the dialogues.</span></p>

<p>According to various ethical theories, which have chiefly obtained currency in modern times, the distinction &mdash; between pleasures good or fit to be enjoyed, and pleasures bad or unfit to be
enjoyed &mdash; is determined for us by a moral sense or intuition: by a simple, peculiar, sentiment of right and wrong, or a conscience, which springs up within us ready-made, and decides on such
matters without appeal; so that a man has only to look into his own heart for a solution. We need not take account of this hypothesis, in reviewing Plato&rsquo;s philosophy: for he evidently does not
proceed upon it. He expressly affirms, in the Gorgias as well as in the Protagoras, that the question is one requiring science or knowledge to determine it, and upon <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page349" id="v2page349"></a>349</span>which none but the man of science or <i>expert</i> (&tau;&epsilon;&chi;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&#8056;&sigmaf;) is a competent judge.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_39" id="Sidenotev2_24_39"></a> In both dialogues the doctrine of Sokrates is self-regarding as respects the agent: not considering the pleasures and
pains of other persons, so far as affected by the agent.</span></p>

<p>Moreover, there is another point common to both the two dialogues, deserving of notice. I have already remarked when reviewing the doctrine of Sokrates in the Protagoras, that it appears to me
seriously defective, inasmuch as it takes into account the pleasures and pains of the agent only, and omits the pleasures and pains of other persons affected by his conduct. But this is not less true
respecting the doctrine of Sokrates in the Gorgias: for whatever criterion he may there have in his mind to determine which among our pleasures are bad, it is certainly not this &mdash; that the
agent in procuring them is obliged to hurt others. For the example which Sokrates cites as specially illustrating the class of bad pleasures &mdash; <i>viz.</i>, the pleasure of scratching an itching
part of the body<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_79" href="#Footnotev2_24_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> &mdash; is one in which no others besides the agent are concerned. As in the Protagoras, so in the
Gorgias &mdash; Plato in laying down his rule of life, admits into the theory only what concerns the agent himself, and makes no direct reference to the happiness of others as affected by the
agent&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_24_79" id="Footnotev2_24_79"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_24_79">79</a></span> The Sokrates of the Protagoras would have reckoned this among the bad
pleasures, because the discomfort and distress of body out of which it arises more than countervail the pleasure.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_40" id="Sidenotev2_24_40"></a> Points wherein the doctrine of the two dialogues is in substance the same, but differing in classification.</span></p>

<p>There are however various points of analogy between the Protagoras and the Gorgias, which will enable us, after tracing them out, to measure the amount of substantial difference between them; I
speak of the reasoning of Sokrates in each. Thus, in the Protagoras,<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_80" href="#Footnotev2_24_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a> Sokrates ranks health, strength, preservation of
the community, wealth, command, &amp;c., under the general head of Good things, but expressly on the ground that they are the producing causes and conditions of pleasures and of exemption from pains:
he also ranks sickness and poverty under the head of Evil things, as productive causes of pain and suffering. In the Gorgias also, he numbers wisdom, health, strength, perfection of body, riches,
&amp;c., among Good things or profitable things<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_81" href="#Footnotev2_24_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a> &mdash; (which two words he treats as <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page350" id="v2page350"></a>350</span>equivalent) &mdash; and their contraries as Evil things. Now he does not expressly say here (as in the Protagoras) that these things are <i>good</i>, because
they are productive causes of pleasure or exemption from pain: but such assumption must evidently be supplied in order to make the reasoning valid. For upon what pretence can any one pronounce
strength, health, riches, to be <i>good</i> &mdash; and helplessness, sickness, poverty, to be <i>evil</i> &mdash; if no reference be admitted to pleasures and pains? Sokrates in the Gorgias<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_24_82" href="#Footnotev2_24_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a> declares that the pleasures of eating and drinking are good, in so far as they impart health and strength to the body
&mdash; evil, in so far as they produce a contrary effect. Sokrates in the Protagoras reasons in the same way &mdash; but with this difference &mdash; that he would count the pleasure of the repast
itself as one item of good: enhancing the amount of good where the future consequences are beneficial, diminishing the amount of evil where the future consequences are Unfavourable: while Sokrates in
the Gorgias excludes immediate pleasure from the list of good things, and immediate pain from the list of evil things.</p>

</div>

<p>This last exclusion renders the theory in the Gorgias untenable and inconsistent. If present pleasure be not admitted as an item of good so far as it goes &mdash; then neither can the future and
consequent aggregates of pleasure, nor the causes of them, be admitted as good. So likewise, if present pain be no evil, future pain cannot be allowed to rank as an evil.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_83"

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_24_83" id="Footnotev2_24_83"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_24_83">83</a></span> Compare a passage in the Republic (ii. p. 357) where Sokrates gives
(or accepts, as given by Glaukon) a description of Good much more coincident with the Protagoras than with the Gorgias. The common property of all Good is to be desired or loved; and there are three
varieties of it &mdash; 1. That which we desire for itself, and for its own sake, apart from all ulterior consequences, such as innocuous pleasures or enjoyments. 2. That which we desire both for
itself and for its ulterior consequences, such as good health, good vision, good sense, &amp;c. 3. That which we do not desire &mdash; nay, which we perhaps hate or shun, <i>per se</i>: but which we
nevertheless desire and invite, in connection with and for the sake of ulterior consequences: such as gymnastic training, medical treatment when we are sick, labour in our trade or profession.</p>

<p>Here Plato admits the immediately pleasurable <i>per se</i> as one variety of good, always assuming that it is not countervailed by consequences or accompaniments of a painful character. This is
the doctrine of the Protagoras, as distinguished from the Gorgias, where Sokrates sets pleasure in marked opposition to good.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_41" id="Sidenotev2_24_41"></a> Kallikl&ecirc;s, whom Sokrates refutes in the Gorgias, maintains a different argument from that which Sokrates combats
in the Protagoras.</span></p>

<p>Each of the two dialogues, which I am now comparing, is in truth an independent composition: in each, Sokrates has a distinct argument to combat; and in the latest of the two (whichever that was),
no heed is taken of <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page351" id="v2page351"></a>351</span>the argumentation in the earlier. In the Protagoras, he exalts the dignity and paramount force of knowledge
or prudence: if a man knows how to calculate pleasures and pains, he will be sure to choose the result which involves the greater pleasure or the less pain, on the whole: to say that he is
overpowered by immediate pleasure or pain into making a bad choice, is a wrong description &mdash; the real fact being, that he is deficient in the proper knowledge how to choose. In the Gorgias, the
doctrine assigned to Kallikl&ecirc;s and impugned by Sokrates is something very different. That justice, temperance, self-restraint, are indeed indispensable to the happiness of ordinary men; but if
there be any one individual, so immensely superior in force as to trample down and make slaves of the rest, this one man would be a fool if he restrained himself: having the means of gratifying all
his appetites, the more appetites he has, the more enjoyments will he have and the greater happiness.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_84" href="#Footnotev2_24_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a> Observe &mdash;
that Kallikl&ecirc;s applies this doctrine only to the one omnipotent despot: to all other members of society, he maintains that self-restraint is essential. This is the doctrine which Sokrates in
the Gorgias undertakes to refute, by denying community of nature between the pleasurable and the good &mdash; between the painful and the evil.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_24_84" id="Footnotev2_24_84"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_24_84">84</a></span> Plato, Gorgias, p. 492 B.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_42" id="Sidenotev2_24_42"></a> The refutation of Kallikl&ecirc;s by Sokrates in the Gorgias, is unsuccessful &mdash; it is only so far successful as
he adopts unintentionally the doctrine of Sokrates in the Protagoras.</span></p>

<p>To me his refutation appears altogether unsuccessful, and the position upon which he rests it incorrect. The only parts of the refutation really forcible, are those in which he unconsciously
relinquishes this position, and slides into the doctrine of the Protagoras. Upon this latter doctrine, a refutation might be grounded: you may show that even an omnipotent despot (regard for the
comfort of others being excluded by the hypothesis) will gain by limiting the gratification of his appetites to-day so as not to spoil his appetites of tomorrow. Even in his case, prudential
restraint is required, though his motives for it would be much less than in the case of ordinary social men. But Good, as laid down by Plato in the Gorgias, entirely disconnected from pleasure<span
class="pagenum"><a name="v2page352" id="v2page352"></a>352</span> &mdash; and Evil, entirely disconnected from pain &mdash; have no application to this supposed despot. He has no desire for such
Platonic Good &mdash; no aversion for such Platonic Evil. His happiness is not diminished by missing the former or incurring the latter. In fact, one of the cardinal principles of Plato&rsquo;s
ethical philosophy, which he frequently asserts both in this dialogue and elsewhere,<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_85" href="#Footnotev2_24_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a> &mdash; That every man desires
Good, and acts for the sake of obtaining Good, and avoiding Evil &mdash; becomes untrue, if you conceive Good and Evil according to the Gorgias, as having no reference to pleasure or the avoidance of
pain: untrue, not merely in regard to a despot under these exceptional conditions, but in regard to the large majority of social men. They desire to obtain Good and avoid Evil, in the sense of the
Protagoras: but not in the sense of the Gorgias.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_86" href="#Footnotev2_24_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> Sokrates himself proclaims in this dialogue: &ldquo;I and philosophy
stand opposed to Kallikl&ecirc;s and the Athenian public. What I desire is, to reason consistently with myself.&rdquo; That is, to speak the language of Sokrates in the Protagoras &mdash; &ldquo;To
me, Sokrates, the consciousness of inconsistency with myself and of an unworthy character, the loss of my own self-esteem and the pungency of my own self-reproach, are the greatest of all pains:
greater than those which you, Kallikl&ecirc;s, and the Athenians generally, seek to avoid at all price and urge me also to avoid at all price &mdash; poverty, political nullity, exposure <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page353" id="v2page353"></a>353</span>to false accusation, &amp;c.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_87" href="#Footnotev2_24_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> The noble scheme of
life, here recommended by Sokrates, may be correctly described according to the theory of the Protagoras: without any resort to the paradox of the Gorgias, that Good has no kindred or reference to
Pleasure, nor Evil to Pain.</p>

the two dialogues.</span></p>

<p>Lastly I will compare the Protagoras and the Gorgias (meaning always, the reasoning of Sokrates in each of them) under one more point of view. How does each of them describe and distinguish the
permanent elements, and the transient elements, involved in human agency? What function does each of them assign to the permanent element? The distinction of these two is important in its ethical
bearing. The whole life both of the individual and of society consists of successive moments of action or feeling. But each individual (and the society as an aggregate of individuals) has within him
embodied and realised an element more or less permanent &mdash; an established character, habits, dispositions, intellectual acquirements, &amp;c. &mdash; a sort of capital accumulated from the past.
This permanent element is of extreme importance. It stands to the transient element in the same relation as the fixed capital of a trader or manufacturer to his annual produce. The whole use and
value of the fixed capital, of which the skill and energy of the trader himself make an important part, consists in the amount of produce which it will yield: but at the same time the trader must
keep it up in its condition of fixed capital, in order to obtain such amount: he must set apart, and abstain from devoting to immediate enjoyment, as much of the annual produce as will suffice to
maintain the fixed capital unimpaired &mdash; and more, if he desires to improve his condition. The capital cannot be commuted into interest; yet nevertheless its whole value depends upon, and is
measured by, the interest which it yields. Doubtless the mere idea of possessing the capital is pleasurable to the possessor, because he knows that it can and will be profitably employed, so long as
he chooses.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_44" id="Sidenotev2_24_44"></a> In the Protagoras.</span></p>

<p>Now in the Protagoras, the permanent element is very pointedly distinguished from the transient, and is called Knowledge &mdash; the Science or Art of Calculation. <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page354" id="v2page354"></a>354</span>Its function also is clearly announced &mdash; to take comparative estimate and measurement of the transient elements; which are stated to consist of
pleasures and pains, present and future &mdash; near and distant &mdash; certain and uncertain &mdash; faint and strong. To these elements, manifold yet commensurable, the calculation is to apply.
&ldquo;The safety of life&rdquo; (says Sokrates<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_88" href="#Footnotev2_24_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a>) &ldquo;resides in our keeping up this science or art of
calculation.&rdquo; No present enjoyment must be admitted, which would impair it; no present pain must be shunned, which is essential to uphold it. Yet the whole of its value resides in its
application to the comparison of the pleasures and pains.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_45" id="Sidenotev2_24_45"></a> In the Gorgias.</span></p>

<p>In the Gorgias the same two elements are differently described, and less clearly explained. The permanent is termed, Order, arrangement, discipline, a lawful, just, and temperate, cast of mind
(opposed to the doctrine ascribed to Kallikl&ecirc;s, which negatived this element altogether, in the mind of the despot), parallel to health and strength of body: the unordered mind is again the
parallel of the corrupt, distempered, helpless, body; life is not worth having until this is cured.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_89" href="#Footnotev2_24_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> This corresponds
to the knowledge or Calculating Science in the Protagoras; but we cannot understand what its function is, in the Gorgias, because the calculable elements are incompletely enumerated.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_24_89" id="Footnotev2_24_89"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_24_89">89</a></span> Plato, Gorgias, pp. 504 B-C, 506 D-E. &Tau;&#940;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf;

&#7936;&kappa;&omicron;&sigma;&mu;&#942;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Protagoras, these calculable elements are two-fold &mdash; immediate pleasures and pains &mdash; and future or distant pleasures and pains. Between these two there is intercommunity of
nature, so that they are quite commensurable; and the function of the calculating reason is, to make a right estimate of the one against the other.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_90" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a> But in the Gorgias, no mention is made of future or distant pleasures and pains: the calculable element is represented only by immediate pleasure or
pain &mdash; and from thence we pass at once to the permanent calculator &mdash; the mind, sound or corrupt. You must abstain from a particular enjoyment, because it will <span class="pagenum"><a
name="v2page355" id="v2page355"></a>355</span>taint the soundness of your mind: this is a pertinent reason (and would be admitted as such by Sokrates in the Protagoras, who instead of sound mind
would say, calculating intelligence), but it is neither the ultimate reason (since this soundness of mind is itself valuable with a view to future calculations), nor the only reason: for you must
also abstain, if it will bring upon yourself (or upon others) preponderating pains in the particular case &mdash; if the future pains would preponderate over the present pleasure. Of this last
calculation no notice is taken in the Gorgias: which exhibits only the antithesis (not merely marked but even over-done<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_91" href="#Footnotev2_24_91"><span class=
"sp">91</span></a>) between the immediate pleasure or pain and the calculating efficacy of mind, but leaves out the true function which gives value to the sound mind as distinguished from the unsound
and corrupt. That function consists in its application to particular cases: in right dealing with actual life, as regards the agent himself and others: in
&#7952;&nu;&epsilon;&rho;&gamma;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha;, as distinguished from &#7957;&xi;&iota;&sigmaf;, to use Aristotelian language.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_92" href="#Footnotev2_24_92"><span class=
"sp">92</span></a> I am far from supposing that this part of the case was absent from Plato&rsquo;s mind. But the theory laid out in the Gorgias (as compared with that in the Protagoras) leaves no
room for it; giving exclusive prominence to the other elements, and acknowledging only the present pleasure or pain, to be set against the permanent condition of mind, bad or good as it may be.</p>

the pains and pleasures of the agent himself (which alone are regarded in the calculation of Sokrates in the Protagoras) you admit into the calculation the pleasures and pains of others concerned,

ethical theory, to the permanent element, or established character of the agent, intellectual and emotional. But great as they reckoned this value to be, they resolved it all into the diminution or
mitigation of pains, and, in a certain though inferior degree, the multiplication of pleasures. They did not put it in a separate category of its own, altogether disparate and foreign to pleasures
and pains.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_46" id="Sidenotev2_24_46"></a> Character of the Gorgias generally &mdash; discrediting all the actualities of life.</span></p>

<p>Indeed there is nothing more remarkable in the Gorgias, than the manner in which Sokrates not only condemns the unmeasured, exorbitant, maleficent desires, but also depreciates and degrades all
the actualities of life &mdash; all the recreative and elegant arts, including music and poetry, tragic as well as dithyrambic &mdash; all provision for the most essential wants, all protection
against particular <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page356" id="v2page356"></a>356</span>sufferings and dangers, even all service rendered to another person in the way of relief or of rescue<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_24_93" href="#Footnotev2_24_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a> &mdash; all the effective maintenance of public organised force, such as ships, docks, walls, arms, &amp;c. Immediate
satisfaction or relief, and those who confer it, are treated with contempt, and presented as in hostility to the perfection of the mental structure. And it is in this point of view that various
Platonic commentators extol in an especial manner the Gorgias: as recognising an Idea of Good superhuman and supernatural, radically disparate from pleasures and pains of any human being, and
incommensurable with them: an Universal Idea, which, though it is supposed to cast a distant light <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page357" id="v2page357"></a>357</span>upon its particulars, is
separated from them by an incalculable space, and is discernible only by the Platonic telescope.</p>

<p>This is applied to the provision of food, drink, clothing, bedding, for the hunger, thirst, &amp;c., of the community (p. 517 D), to the saving of life (p. 511 D). The boatman between &AElig;gina
and Peir&aelig;us (says Plato) brings over his passengers in safety, together with their families and property, preserving them from all the dangers of the sea. The engineer, who constructs good
fortifications, preserves from danger and destruction all the citizens with their families and their property (p. 512 B). But neither of these persons takes credit for this service: because both of
them know that it is doubtful whether they have done any real service to the persons preserved, since they have not rendered them any better; and that it is even doubtful whether they may not have
done them an actual mischief. Perhaps these persons may be wicked and corrupt; in that case it is a misfortune to them that their lives should be prolonged; it would be better for them to die. It is
under this conviction (says Plato) that the boatman and the engineer, though they do preserve our lives, take to themselves no credit for it.</p>

<p>We shall hardly find any greater rhetorical exaggeration than this, among all the compositions of the rhetors against whom Plato declares war in the Gorgias. Moreover, it is a specimen of the way
in which Plato colours and misinterprets the facts of social life, in order to serve the purpose of the argument of the moment. He says truly that when the passage boat from &AElig;gina to
Peir&aelig;us has reached its destination, the steersman receives his fare and walks about on the shore, without taking any great credit to himself, as if he had performed a brilliant deed or
conferred an important service. But how does Plato explain this? By supposing in the steersman&rsquo;s mind feelings which never enter into the mind of a real agent; feelings which are put into words
only when a moralist or a satirist is anxious to enforce a sentiment. The service which the steersman performs is not only adequately remunerated, but is, on most days, a regular and easy one, such
as every man who has gone through a decent apprenticeship can perform. But suppose an exceptional day &mdash; suppose a sudden and terrible storm to supervene on the passage &mdash; suppose the boat
full of passengers, with every prospect of all on board being drowned &mdash; suppose she is only saved by the extraordinary skill, vigilance, and efforts of the steersman. In that case he will, on
reaching the land, walk about full of elate self-congratulation and pride: the passengers will encourage this sentiment by expressions of the deepest gratitude; while friends as well as competitors
will praise his successful exploit. How many of the passengers there are for whom the preservation of life may be a curse rather than a blessing &mdash; is a question which neither they themselves,
nor the steersman, nor the public, will ever dream of asking.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_47" id="Sidenotev2_24_47"></a> Argument of Sokrates resumed &mdash; multifarious arts of flattery, aiming at immediate pleasure.</span></p>

<p>We have now established (continues Sokrates) that pleasure is essentially different from good, and pain from evil: also, that to obtain good and avoid evil, a scientific choice is required &mdash;
while to obtain pleasure and avoid pain, is nothing more than blind imitation or irrational knack. There are some arts and pursuits which aim only at procuring immediate pleasure &mdash; others which
aim at attaining good or the best;<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_94" href="#Footnotev2_24_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a> some arts, for a single person, &mdash; others for a multitude. Arts and pursuits
which aim only at immediate pleasure, either of one or of a multitude, belong to the general head of Flattery. Among them are all the musical, choric, and dithyrambic representations at the festivals
&mdash; tragedy as well as comedy &mdash; also political and judicial rhetoric. None of these arts aim at any thing except to gratify the public to whom they are addressed: none of them aim at the
permanent good: none seek to better the character of the public. They adapt themselves to the prevalent desires: but whether those desires are such as, if realised, will make the public worse or
better, they never enquire.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_95" href="#Footnotev2_24_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_24_94" id="Footnotev2_24_94"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_24_94">94</a></span> The Sokrates of the Protagoras would have admitted a twofold
distinction of aims, but would have stated the distinction otherwise. Two things (he would say) may be looked at in regard to any course of conduct: first, the immediate pleasure or pain which it
yields; secondly, this item, not alone, but combined with all the other pleasures and pains which can be foreseen as its conditions, consequences, or concomitants. To obey the desire of immediate
pleasure, or the fear of immediate pain, requires no science; to foresee, estimate, and compare the consequences, requires a scientific calculation often very difficult and complicated &mdash; a
&tau;&#941;&chi;&nu;&eta; or &#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta; &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&eta;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;.</p>

<p>Thus we are told not only in what cases the calculation is required, but what are the elements to be taken into the calculation. In the Gorgias, we are not told on what elements the calculation of
good and evil is to be based: we are told that there <i>must be science</i>, but we learn nothing more.</p>

<p>We ought to do (continues Sokrates) what is pleasing for the sake of what is good: not <i>vice vers&agrave;</i>. But every thing becomes good by possessing its appropriate virtue or regulation.
The regulation appropriate to the mind is to be temperate. The temperate man will do what is just &mdash; his duty towards men: and what is holy &mdash; his duty towards the Gods. He will be just and
holy. He will therefore also be courageous: for he will seek only such pleasures as duty permits, and he will endure all such pains as duty requires. Being thus temperate, just, brave, holy, he will
be a perfectly good man, doing well and honourably throughout. The man who does well, will be happy: the man who does ill and is wicked, will be miserable.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_99" href=

<p>Such are the essential conditions of political success and popularity. But I, Kallikl&ecirc;s, have already distinguished two schemes of life; one aiming at pleasure, the other aiming at good:
one, that of the statesman who studies the felt wants, wishes, and impulses of the people, displaying his genius in providing for them effective satisfaction &mdash; the other, the statesman who
makes it his chief or sole object to amend the character and disposition of the people. The last scheme is the only one which I approve: and if it be that to which you invite me, we must examine
whether either you, Kallikles, or I, have ever yet succeeded in amending or improving the character of any individuals privately, before we undertake the task of amending the citizens collectively.<a

people &mdash; to transfer the desires of the people from worse things to better things &mdash; or to create in them justice and temperance. They thus did no real good by feeding the desires of the
people: no more good than would be done by a skilful cook for a sick man, in cooking for him a sumptuous meal before the physician had cured him.</p>

stands proclaimed &mdash; especially in the Kriton, where he declares that his difference with his opponents is fundamental, and that there can be between them no common ground for debate &mdash;

community.</span></p>

<p>The argument of Sokrates in the Gorgias is interesting, not merely as extolling the value of ethical self-restraint, but also as considering political phenomena under this point of view: that is,
merging politics in ethics. The proper and paramount function of statesmen (we find it eloquently proclaimed) is to serve as spiritual teachers in the community: for the purpose of amending the lives
and characters of the citizens, and of converting them from bad dispositions to good. We are admonished that until this is effected, more is lost than gained by realising the actual wants and wishes
of the community, which are disorderly and distempered: like the state of a sick man, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page363" id="v2page363"></a>363</span>who would receive harm and not benefit
from a sumptuous banquet.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_57" id="Sidenotev2_24_57"></a> <i>Id&eacute;al</i> of Plato &mdash; a despotic lawgiver or man-trainer, on scientific principles, fashioning all
characters pursuant to certain types of his own.</span></p>

<p>This is the conception of Plato in the Gorgias, speaking through the person of Sokrates, respecting the ends for which the political magistrate ought to employ his power. The magistrate, as
administering law and justice, is to the minds of the community what the trainer and the physician are to their bodies: he produces goodness of mind, as the two latter produce health and strength of
body. The Platonic <i>id&eacute;al</i> is that of a despotic law-giver and man-trainer, wielding the compulsory force of the secular arm for what he believes to be spiritual improvement. However
instructive it is to study the manner in which a mind like that of Plato works out such a purpose in theory, there is no reason for regret that he never had an opportunity of carrying it into
practice. The manner in which he always keeps in view the standing mental character, as an object of capital importance to be attended to, and as the analogon of health in the body &mdash; deserves
all esteem. But when he assumes the sceptre of King Nomos (as in Republic and Leges) to fix by unchangeable authority what shall be the orthodox type of character, and to suppress all the varieties
of emotion and intellect, except such as will run into a few predetermined moulds &mdash; he oversteps all the reasonable aims and boundaries of the political office.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_58" id="Sidenotev2_24_58"></a> Platonic analogy between mental goodness and bodily health &mdash; incomplete analogy &mdash; circumstances of
difference.</span></p>

<p>Plato forgets two important points of difference, in that favourite and very instructive analogy which he perpetually reproduces, between mental goodness and bodily health. First, good health and
strength of the body (as I have observed already) are states which every man knows when he has got them. Though there is much doubt and dispute about causes, preservative, destructive, and
restorative, there is none about the present fact. Every sick man derives from his own sensations an anxiety to get well. But virtue is not a point thus fixed, undisputed, indubitable: it is
differently conceived by different persons, and must first be discovered and settled by a process of enquiry; the Platonic Sokrates himself, in many of the dialogues &mdash; after declaring that
neither he nor any <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page364" id="v2page364"></a>364</span>one else within his knowledge, knows what it is &mdash; tries to find it out without success. Next, the
physician, who is the person actively concerned in imparting health and strength, exercises no coercive power over any one: those who consult him have the option whether they will follow the advice
given, or not. To put himself upon the same footing with the physician, the political magistrate ought to confine himself to the function of advice; a function highly useful, but in which he will be
called upon to meet argumentative opposition, and frequent failure, together with the mortification of leaving those whom he cannot convince, to follow their own mode of life. Here are two material
differences, modifying the applicability of that very analogy on which Plato so frequently rests his proof.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_24_59" id="Sidenotev2_24_59"></a> Sokrates in the Gorgias speaks like a dissenter among a community of fixed opinions and habits. Impossible that a
dissenter, on important points, should acquire any public influence.</span></p>

<p>In Plato&rsquo;s two imaginary commonwealths, where he is himself despotic law-giver, there would have been no tolerable existence possible for any one not shaped upon the Platonic spiritual
model. But in the Gorgias, Plato (speaking in the person of Sokrates) is called upon to define his plan of life in a free state, where he was merely a private citizen. Sokrates receives from
Kallikles the advice, to forego philosophy and to aspire to the influence and celebrity of an active public speaker. His reply is instructive, as revealing the interior workings of every political
society. No man (he says) can find favour as an adviser &mdash; either of a despot, where there is one, or of a people where there is free government &mdash; unless he be in harmony with the
sentiments and ideas prevalent, either with the ruling Many or the ruling One. He must be moulded, from youth upwards, on the same spiritual pattern as they are:<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_117" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a> his love and hate, his praise and blame, must turn towards the same things: he must have the same tastes, the same morality, the same <i>
id&eacute;al</i>, as theirs: he must be no imitator, but a chip of the same block. If he be either better than they or worse than they,<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_118" href="#Footnotev2_24_118"><span
class="sp">118</span></a> he will fail in acquiring popularity, and his efforts as a competitor for public <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page365" id="v2page365"></a>365</span>influence will be not
only abortive, but perhaps dangerous to himself.</p>

dialectic.</span></p>

<p>The reasons which Sokrates gives here (as well as in the Apology, and partly also in the Republic) for not embarking in the competition of political aspirants, are of very general application. He
is an innovator in religion; and a dissenter from the received ethics, politics, social sentiment, and estimate of life and conduct.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_119" href="#Footnotev2_24_119"><span class=

think himself fortunate if he escapes without personal hurt or loss. Whether his dissent be for the better or for the worse, is a matter of little moment: the ruling body always think it worse, and
the consequences to the dissenter are the same.</p>

Sokrates to Kallikl&ecirc;s),<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_120" href="#Footnotev2_24_120"><span class="sp">120</span></a> &ldquo;are in love with the Athenian people, and take up or renounce such opinions

becoming unconsciously corrupted, if you carry it beyond such elementary stage.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_121" href="#Footnotev2_24_121"><span class="sp">121</span></a> Each of these <span class=

religion, taste, politics, &amp;c. His success depended mainly on the emphasis which his eloquence could lend to such maxims, and on the skill with which he could apply them to the case in hand. But
Sokrates could not follow such an example. Anxious in his research after truth, he applied the test of analysis to the prevalent opinions &mdash; found them, in his judgment, neither consistent nor
rational &mdash; constrained many persons to feel this, by an humiliating cross-examination &mdash; but became disqualified from addressing, with any chance of assent, the assembled public.</p>

<p>The view here advocated by Kallikles:&mdash;That philosophy is good and useful, to be studied up to a point in the earlier years of life, in order to qualify persons for effective discharge of the
duties of active citizenship, but that it ought not to be made the main occupation of mature life, nor be prosecuted up to the pitch of accurate theorising: this view, since Plato here assigns it to
Kallikles, is denounced by most of the Platonic critics as if it were low and worthless. Yet it was held by many of the most respectable citizens of antiquity; and the question is, in point of fact,
that which has always been in debate between the life of theoretical speculation and the life of action.</p>

<p>Isokrates urges the same view both in Orat. xv. De Permutatione, sect. 282-287, pp. 485-486, Bekker; and Orat. xii. Panathenaic. sect. 29-32, p. 321, Bekker.

<p>That in order to succeed politically, a man must be a genuine believer in the creed of King Nomos or the ruling force &mdash; cast in the same spiritual mould &mdash; (I here take the word <i>
creed</i> not as confined to religion, but as embracing the whole of a man&rsquo;s critical <i>id&eacute;al</i>, on moral or social practice, politics, or taste &mdash; the ends which he deems worthy
of being aspired to, or proper to be shunned, by himself or others) is laid down by Sokrates as a general position: and with perfect truth. In disposing of the force or influence of government,
whoever possesses that force will use it conformably to his own maxims. A man who dissents from these maxims will find no favour in the public assembly; nor, probably, if his dissent be grave and
wide, will he ever be able to speak out his convictions aloud in it, without incurring dangerous antipathy. But what is to become of such a dissenter<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_122" href=

individual capacity? Debarred, by the necessity of the case, from influence over the public councils &mdash; what latitude of pursuit, profession, or conduct, is to be left to him as a citizen? How
far is he to question, or expose, or require to be proved, that which the majority believe without proof? Shall he be required to profess, or to obey, or to refrain from contradicting, religious or
ethical doctrines which he has examined and rejected? Shall such requirement be enforced by threat of legal penalties, or of ill-treatment from individuals, which is not less intolerable than legal
penalties? What is likely to be his character, if compelled to suppress all declaration of his own creed, and to act and speak as if he were believer in another?</p>

philosophy, but without the indiscriminate cross-examination pursued by Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>The questions here suggested must have impressed themselves forcibly on the mind of Plato when he recollected the fate of Sokrates. In spite of a blameless life, Sokrates had been judicially
condemned and executed for publicly questioning received opinions, innovating upon the established religion, and instilling into young persons habits of doubt. To dissent only for the better,
afforded no assurance of safety: and Plato knew well that his own dissent from the Athenian public was even wider and more systematic than that of his master. The position and plan of life for an
active-minded reasoner, dissenting from the established opinions of the public, could not but be an object of interesting reflection to him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_123" href="#Footnotev2_24_123"><span
class="sp">123</span></a> The Gorgias (written, in my judgment, long after the death of Sokrates, probably after the Platonic school was established) announces the vocation of the philosopher, and
claims an open field for speculation, apart from the actualities of politics &mdash; for the self-acting reason of the individual doubter and investigator, against the authority of <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page368" id="v2page368"></a>368</span>numbers and the pressure of inherited tradition. A formal assertion to this effect was worthy of the founder of the Academy &mdash; the
earliest philosophical school at Athens. Yet we may observe that while the Platonic Sokrates in the Gorgias adopts the life of philosophy, he does not renew that farther demand with which the
historical Sokrates had coupled it in his Apology &mdash; the liberty of oral and aggressive cross-examination, addressed to individuals personally and indiscriminately<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_124"
href="#Footnotev2_24_124"><span class="sp">124</span></a> &mdash; to the <i>primores populi</i> as well as to the <i>populum tributim</i>. The fate of Sokrates rendered Plato more cautious, and
induced him to utter his ethical interrogations and novelties of opinion in no other way except that of lectures to chosen hearers and written dialogue: borrowing the name of Sokrates or some other
speaker, and refraining upon system (as his letters<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_125" href="#Footnotev2_24_125"><span class="sp">125</span></a> tell us that he did) from publishing any doctrines in his own

intolerance.</span></p>

<p>As a man dissenting from received opinions, Sokrates had his path marked out in the field of philosophy or individual speculation. To such a mind as his, the fullest liberty ought to be left, of
professing and defending his own opinions, as well as of combating other opinions, accredited or not, which he may consider false or uncertified.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_126" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_126"><span class="sp">126</span></a> The public guidance of the state thus falls to one class of minds, the activity of speculative discussion to another; though accident <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="v2page369" id="v2page369"></a>369</span>may produce, here and there, a superior individual, comprehensive or dexterous enough to suffice for both. But the main desideratum is that
this freedom of discussion should exist: that room shall be made, and encouragement held out, to the claims of individual reason, and to the full publication of all doubts or opinions, be they what
they may: that the natural tendency of all ruling force, whether in few or in many hands, to perpetuate their own dogmas by proscribing or silencing all heretics and questioners, may be neutralised
as far as possible. The great expansive vigour of the Greek mind &mdash; the sympathy felt among the best varieties of Greeks for intellectual superiority in all its forms &mdash; and the privilege
of free speech (&pi;&alpha;&#8164;&#8165;&eta;&sigma;&#943;&alpha;), on which the democratical citizens of Athens prided themselves &mdash; did in fact neutralise very considerably these tendencies
in Athens. A greater and more durable liberty of philosophising was procured for Athens, and through Athens for Greece generally, than had ever been known before in the history of mankind.</p>

<p>The reader will find the speculative individuality of Sokrates illustrated in the sixty-eighth chapter of my History of Greece.</p>

<p>The antithesis of the philosophising or speculative life, against the rhetorical, political, forensic life &mdash; which is put so much to the advantage of the former by Plato in the Gorgias,
The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus (p. 173, seq.), and elsewhere was the theme of Cicero&rsquo;s lost dialogue called Hortensius: wherein Hortensius was introduced pleading the cause against philosophy, (see
Orelli, Fragm. Ciceron. pp. 479-480), while the other speakers were provided by Cicero with arguments mainly in defence of philosophy, partly also against rhetoric. The competition between the
teachers of rhetoric and the teachers of philosophy continued to be not merely animated but bitter, from Plato downward throughout the Ciceronian age. (Cicero, De Orat. i. 45-46-47-75, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>We read in the treatise of Plutarch against the Epikurean Kol&ocirc;tes, an acrimonious invective against Epikurus and his followers, for recommending a scheme of life such as to withdraw men from
active political functions (Plutarch, adv. Kol&ocirc;t. pp. 1125 C, 1127-1128); the like also in his other treatise, Non Posse Suaviter Vivi secundum Epicurum. But Plutarch at the same time speaks as
if Epikurus were the only philosopher who had recommended this, and as if all the other philosophers had recommended an active life; nay, he talks of Plato among the philosophers actively engaged in
practical reformatory legislation, through Dion and the pupils of the Academy (p. 1126, B, C). Here Plutarch mistakes: the Platonic tendencies were quite different from what he supposes. The Gorgias
and The&aelig;t&ecirc;tus enforce upon the philosopher a life quite apart from politics, pursuing his own course, and not meddling with others &mdash;
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&#972;&phi;&omicron;&upsilon; &tau;&#8048; &alpha;&#8017;&tau;&omicron;&#8166; &pi;&rho;&#940;&xi;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;

is the same advice as Epikurus gave. It is set forth eloquently in the poetry of Lucretius, but it had been set forth previously, not less eloquently, in the rhetoric of Plato.</p>

manner in which it is presented by Polus and Kallikl&ecirc;s.</span></p>

<p>This antithesis of the philosophical life to the rhetorical or political, constitutes one of the most interesting features of the Platonic Gorgias. But when we follow the pleadings upon which
Plato rests this grand issue, and the line which he draws between the two functions, we find much that is unsatisfactory. Since Plato himself pleads both sides of the case, he is bound in fairness to
set forth the case which he attacks (that of rhetoric), as it would be put by competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page370" id="v2page370"></a>370</span> and honourable advocates &mdash; by
Perikles, for example, or Demosthenes, or Isokrates, or Quintilian. He does this, to a certain extent, in the first part of the dialogue, carried on by Sokrates with Gorgias. But in the succeeding
portions &mdash; carried on with P&ocirc;lus and Kallikl&ecirc;s, and occupying three-fourths of the whole &mdash; he alters the character of the defence, and merges it in ethical theories which
Perikles, had he been the defender, would not only have put aside as misplaced, but disavowed as untrue. Perikles would have listened with mixed surprise and anger, if he had heard any one utter the
monstrous assertion which Plato puts into the mouth of Polus &mdash; That rhetors, like despots, kill, impoverish, or expel any citizen at their pleasure. Though Perikles was the most powerful of all
Athenian rhetors, yet he had to contend all his life against fierce opposition from others, and was even fined during his last years. He would hardly have understood how an Athenian citizen could
have made any assertion so completely falsified by all the history of Athens, respecting the omnipotence of the rhetors. Again, if he had heard Kallikl&ecirc;s proclaiming that the strong giant had a
natural right to satiate all his desires at the cost of the weaker Many &mdash; and that these latter sinned against Nature when they took precautions to prevent him &mdash; Perikles would have
protested against the proclamation as emphatically as Plato.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_127" href="#Footnotev2_24_127"><span class="sp">127</span></a></p>

<p>If we suppose Perikles to have undertaken the defence of the rhetorical element at Athens, against the dialectic element represented by Sokrates, he would have accepted it, though not a position
of his own choosing, on the footing on which Plato places it in the mouth of Gorgias: &ldquo;Rhetoric is an engine of persuasion addressed to numerous assembled auditors: it ensures freedom to the
city (through the free exercise of such a gift by many competing orators) and political ascendency or command to the ablest rhetor. It thus confers great power on him who possesses it in the highest
measure: but he ought by no means to employ that power for unjust purposes.&rdquo; It is very probable that Perikles might have recommended rhetorical study to Sokrates,<span class="pagenum"><a name=

href="#Footnotev2_24_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a> But he would have distinguished carefully (as Horace does) between defending yourself against unjust attacks, and making unjust attacks upon

<p>We need only read the Memorabilia of Xenophon (ii. 9), to see that the historical Sokrates judged of these matters differently from the Platonic Sokrates of the Gorgias. Kriton complained to
Sokrates that life was difficult at Athens for a quiet man who wished only to mind his own business (&tau;&#8048; &#7953;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&#8166;
&pi;&rho;&#940;&tau;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;); because there were persons who brought unjust actions at law against him, for the purpose of extorting money to buy them off. The Platonic Sokrates of
the Gorgias would have replied to him: &ldquo;Never mind: you are just, and these assailants are unjust: they are by their own conduct entailing upon themselves a terrible distemper, from which, if
you leave them unpunished, they will suffer all their lives: they injure themselves more than they injure you&rdquo;. But the historical Sokrates in Xenophon replies in quite another spirit. He
advises Kriton to look out for a clever and active friend, to attach this person to his interest by attention and favours, and to trust to him for keeping off the assailants. Accordingly, a poor but
energetic man named Archedemus is found, who takes Kriton&rsquo;s part against the assailants, and even brings counterattacks against them, which force them to leave Kriton alone, and to give money
to Archedemus himself. The advice given by the Xenophontic Sokrates to Kriton is the same in principle as the advice given by Kallikles to the Platonic Sokrates.</p>

conceived.</span></p>

<p>Farther, neither Perikles, nor any defender of free speech, would assent to the definition of rhetoric &mdash; That it is a branch of the art of flattery, studying the immediately pleasurable, and
disregarding the good.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_129" href="#Footnotev2_24_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a> This indeed represents Plato&rsquo;s own sentiment, and was true in the sense which the
Platonic Sokrates assigns (in the Gorgias, though not in the Protagoras) to the words <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i>. But it is not true in the sense which the Athenian people and the Athenian public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page372" id="v2page372"></a>372</span>men assigned to those words. Both the one and the other used the words <i>pleasurable</i> and <i>good</i> as familiarly as
Plato, and had sentiments corresponding to both of them. The pleasurable and painful referred to present and temporary causes: the Good and Evil to prospective causes and permanent situations,
involving security against indefinite future suffering, combined with love of national dignity and repugnance to degradation, as well as with a strong sense of common interests and common obligations
to each other. To provide satisfaction for these common patriotic feelings &mdash; to sustain the dignity of the city by effective and even imposing public establishments, against foreign enemies
&mdash; to protect the individual rights of citizens by an equitable administration of justice &mdash; counted in the view of the Athenians as objects <i>good</i> and <i>honourable</i>: while the
efforts and sacrifices necessary for these permanent ends, were, so far as they went, a renunciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page373" id="v2page373"></a>373</span> of what they would call the
<i>pleasurable</i>. When, at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, the Athenians, acting on the advice of Perikles, allowed all Attica to be ravaged, and submitted to the distress of cooping the
whole population within the long walls, rather than purchase peace by abnegating their Hellenic dignity, independence, and security &mdash; they not only renounced much that was pleasurable, but
endured great immediate distress, for the sake of what they regarded as a permanent good.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_130" href="#Footnotev2_24_130"><span class="sp">130</span></a> Eighty years afterwards,
when Demosthenes pointed out to them the growing power and encroachments of the Macedonian Philip, and exhorted them to the efforts requisite for keeping back that formidable enemy, while there was
yet time &mdash; they could not be wound up to the pitch requisite for affronting so serious an amount of danger and suffering. They had lost that sense of Hellenic dignity, and that association of
self-respect with active personal soldiership and sailorship, which rendered submission to an enemy the most intolerable of all pains, at the time when Perikles had addressed them. They shut their
eyes to an impending danger, which ultimately proved their ruin. On both these occasions, we have the <i>pleasurable</i> and the <i>good</i> brought into contrast in the Athenian mind; in both we
have the two most eminent orators of Grecian antiquity enforcing the <i>good</i> in opposition to the <i>pleasurable</i>: the first successfully, the last vainly, in opposition to other orators.</p>

<p>Aristeides insists forcibly on the partial and narrow view here taken by Plato of persuasion, as a working force both for establishing laws and carrying on government. He remarks truly that there
are only two forces between which the choice must be made, intimidation and persuasion: that the substitution of persuasion in place of force is the great improvement which has made public and
private life worth having (&mu;&#972;&nu;&eta; &beta;&iota;&omega;&tau;&#8056;&nu; &#7969;&mu;&#8150;&nu; &pi;&epsilon;&pi;&omicron;&#943;&eta;&kappa;&epsilon; &tau;&#8056;&nu;

&gamma;&upsilon;&mu;&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;, &kappa;&upsilon;&beta;&epsilon;&rho;&nu;&eta;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;,
&nu;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&theta;&epsilon;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;, &amp;c., on the one side, which Plato calls &tau;&#941;&chi;&nu;&alpha;&iota;, arts or sciences, and affirms to rest on scientific
principles &mdash; and &#8165;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#942;, &mu;&alpha;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#942;, &amp;c., on the other side, which Plato affirms to be only guess
work or groping, resting on empirical analogies. Aristeides says that &#7984;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8052; and &#8165;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#8052; are in this respect both on
a par; that both are partly reducible to rule, but partly also driven by necessity to conjectures and analogies, and the physician not less than the rhetor (pp. 45-48-49); which the Platonic Sokrates
himself affirms in another dialogue, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 56 A.</p>

<p>The most curious part of the argument of Aristeides is where he disputes the prerogative which Plato had claimed for &#7984;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&iota;&kappa;&#942;,
&gamma;&upsilon;&mu;&nu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942; &amp;c., on the ground of their being arts or reducible to rules. The effects of human art (says Aristeides) are much inferior to those
of &theta;&epsilon;&#943;&alpha; &mu;&omicron;&#8150;&rho;&alpha; or divine inspiration. Many patients are cured of disease by human art; but many more are cured by the responses and directions of
the Delphian oracle, by the suggestion of dreams, and by other varieties of the divine prompting, delivered through the Pythian priestess, a woman altogether ignorant (p. 11).

personal knowledge of many other such &mdash; how much more efficacious in healing is aid from the Gods, given in dreams and other ways, than advice from physicians; who might well shudder when they

assigns to Kallikl&ecirc;s in the Gorgias, than the three memorable speeches of Perikles in Thucydides, i. 144, ii. 35, ii. 60, seq. All these speeches are penetrated with the deepest sense of that
&kappa;&omicron;&iota;&nu;&omega;&nu;&#943;&alpha; and &phi;&iota;&lambda;&#943;&alpha; which the Platonic Sokrates extols: not one of them countenances

<p>Lastly, it is not merely the political power of the Athenians that Perikles employs his eloquence to uphold. He dwells also with emphasis on the elegance of taste, on the intellectual force and
activity, which warranted him in decorating the city with the title of Preceptress of Hellas.<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_131" href="#Footnotev2_24_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a> All this belongs,

comprehensive sense, embracing the improvement and refinement of the collective mind. If Perikles, in this remarkable funeral harangue, flattered the sentiments of the people &mdash; as he doubtless
did &mdash; he flattered them by kindling their aspirations towards good. And Plato himself does the same (though less nobly and powerfully), adopting the received framework of Athenian sentiment, in

well as to good. Divergent ideas about virtue.</span></p>

<p>The issue, therefore, which Plato here takes against Rhetoric, must stand or fall with the Platonic Id&eacute;al of Good and Evil. But when he thus denounces both the general public and the most
patriotic rhetors, to ensure exclusive worship for his own Id&eacute;al of Good &mdash; we may at least require that he shall explain, wherein consists that Good &mdash; by what mark it is
distinguishable &mdash; and on what authority pre-eminence is claimed for it. So far, indeed, we advance by the help of Plato&rsquo;s similes<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_132" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> &mdash; order, discipline, health and strength of body &mdash; that we are called upon to recognise, apart from all particular moments of
enjoyment or suffering, of action or quiescence, a certain permanent mental condition and habit &mdash; a certain order, regulation, discipline &mdash; as an object of high importance to be attained.
This (as I have before remarked) is a valuable idea which pervades, in one form or another, all the Hellenic social views, from Sokrates downward, and even before Sokrates; an idea, moreover, which
was common to Peripatetics, Stoics, Epikureans. But mental order and discipline is not in itself an end: it may be differently cast, and may subserve many different purposes. The Pythagorean
brotherhood was intensely restrictive in its canons. The Spartan system exhibited the strictest order and discipline &mdash; an assemblage of principles and habits predetermined by authority and
enforced upon all &mdash; yet neither Plato nor Aristotle approve of its results. Order and discipline attained full perfection in the armies of Julius Caesar and the French Emperor Napoleon; in the
middle ages, also, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page375" id="v2page375"></a>375</span>several of the monastic orders stood high in respect to finished discipline pervading the whole character:
and the Jesuits stood higher than any. Each of these systems has included terms equivalent to justice, temperance, virtue, vice, &amp;c., with sentiments associated therewith, yet very different from
what Plato would have approved. The question &mdash; What is Virtue? &mdash; <i>Vir bonus est quis?</i> &mdash; will be answered differently in each. The Spartans &mdash; when they entrapped (by a
delusive pretence of liberation and military decoration) two thousand of their bravest Helot warriors, and took them off by private assassinations,<a name="FnAnchorv2_24_133" href=
"#Footnotev2_24_133"><span class="sp">133</span></a> &mdash; did not offend against their own idea of virtue, or against the Platonic exigency of Order &mdash; Measure &mdash; System.</p>

<p>It is therefore altogether unsatisfactory, when Plato &mdash; professing to teach us how to determine scientifically, which pleasures are bad, and which pains are good &mdash; refers to a durable
mental order and discipline. Of such order there existed historically many varieties; and many more are conceivable, as Plato himself has shown in the Republic and Leges. By what tests is the right
order to be distinguished from the wrong? If by its results, by <i>what</i> results? &mdash; calculations for minimising pains, and maximising pleasures, being excluded by the supposition? Here the
Sokrates of the Gorgias is at fault. He has not told us by what scientific test the intelligent Expert proceeds in determining what pleasures are bad, and what pains are good. He leaves such

<p>I think, for these reasons, that the logic of the Gorgias is not at all on a par with its eloquence. But there is one peculiar feature which distinguishes it among all the Platonic dialogues.
Nowhere in ancient literature is the title, position, and dignity of individual dissenting opinion, ethical and political &mdash; against established ethical and political orthodoxy &mdash; so
clearly marked out and so boldly asserted. &ldquo;The Athenians will judge as they <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page376" id="v2page376"></a>376</span>think right: none but those speakers who are
in harmony with them, have any chance of addressing their public assemblies with effect, and acquiring political influence. I, Sokrates, dissent from them, and have no chance of political influence:
but I claim the right of following out, proclaiming, and defending, the conclusions of my own individual reason, until debate satisfies me that I am wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_1" id="Sidenotev2_25_1"></a> The Ph&aelig;don is affirmative and expository.</span></p>

<p>The Ph&aelig;don is characterised by Proklus as a dialogue wherein Sokrates unfolds fully his own mental history, and communicates to his admirers the complete range of philosophical cognition.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_25_1" href="#Footnotev2_25_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> This criticism is partly well founded. The dialogue generally is among the most affirmative and expository in the Platonic
list. Sokrates undertakes to prove the immortality of the soul, delivers the various reasons which establish the doctrine to his satisfaction, and confutes some dissentient opinions entertained by
others. In regard to the exposition, however, we must consider ourselves as listening to Plato under the name of Sokrates: and we find it so conducted as to specify both certain stages through which
the mind of Plato had passed, and the logical process which (at that time) appeared to him to carry conviction.</p>

thinks (note, ad p. 108 E) that Plato was young when he composed the Ph&aelig;don. But no sufficient grounds are given for this: and the concluding sentence of the dialogue affords good presumption
that it was composed many years after the death of Sokrates &mdash; &#7972;&delta;&epsilon; &#7969; &tau;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&tau;&#942;, &#8038;

that Sokrates belonged to the past generation. The beginning of the dialogue undoubtedly shows that Plato intended to place it shortly after the death of Sokrates; but the word
&tau;&#972;&tau;&epsilon; at the end is inconsistent with this supposition, and comes out unconsciously as a mark of the real time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_2" id="Sidenotev2_25_2"></a> Situation and circumstances assumed in the Ph&aelig;don. Pathetic interest which they inspire.</span></p>

<p>The interest felt by most readers in the Ph&aelig;don, however, depends, not so much on the argumentative exposition (which Wyttenbach<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_2" href="#Footnotev2_25_2"><span class=
"sp">2</span></a> justly pronounces to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page378" id="v2page378"></a>378</span>obscure and difficult as well as unsatisfactory) as on the personality of the
expounding speaker, and the irresistible pathos of the situation. Sokrates had been condemned to death by the Dikastery on the day after the sacred ship, memorable in connection with the legendary
voyage of Theseus to Krete, had been dispatched on her annual mission of religious sacrifice at the island of Delos. The Athenian magistrates considered themselves as precluded from putting any one
to death by public authority, during the absence of the ship on this mission. Thirty days elapsed between her departure and her return: during all which interval, Sokrates remained in the prison, yet
with full permission to his friends to visit him. They passed most of every day in the enjoyment of his conversation.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_3" href="#Footnotev2_25_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> In
the Ph&aelig;don, we read the last of these conversations, after the sacred vessel had returned, and after the Eleven magistrates had announced to Sokrates that the draught of hemlock would be
administered to him before sunset. On communicating this intelligence, the magistrates released Sokrates from the fetters with which he had hitherto been bound. It is shortly after such release that
the friends enter the prison to see him for the last time. One of the number, Ph&aelig;don, recounts to Echekrat&ecirc;s not only the conduct and discourse of Sokrates during the closing hours of his
life, but also the swallowing of the poison, and the manner of his death.</p>

<p>It appears that Kriton became bail before the Dikasts, in a certain sum of money, that Sokrates should remain in prison and not escape (Plat. Ph&aelig;don, p. 115 D; Kriton, 45 B). Kriton would
have been obliged to pay this money if Sokrates had accepted his proposition to escape, noticed already in chap. x.</p>

<p>More than fifteen friends of the philosopher are noted as present at this last scene: but the only two who take an active part in the debate, are, two young Thebans named Keb&ecirc;s and
Simmias.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_4" href="#Footnotev2_25_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> These friends, though deeply attached to Sokrates, and full of sorrow at the irreparable loss impending over
them, are represented as overawed and fascinated by his perfect fearlessness, serenity and dignity.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_5" href="#Footnotev2_25_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> They are ashamed to
give vent to their grief, when their master is seen to maintain his <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page379" id="v2page379"></a>379</span>ordinary frame of mind, neither disquieted nor dissatisfied.
The fundamental conception of the dialogue is, to represent Sokrates as the same man that he was before his trial; unmoved by the situation &mdash; not feeling that any misfortune is about to happen
to him &mdash; equally delighting in intellectual debate &mdash; equally fertile in dialectic invention. So much does he care for debate, and so little for the impending catastrophe, that he persists
in a great argumentative effort, notwithstanding the intimation conveyed by Kriton from the gaoler, that if he heated himself with talking, the poison might perhaps be languid in its operation, so
that two or three draughts of it would be necessary instead of one.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_6" href="#Footnotev2_25_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Sokrates even advances the position that death
appears to him as a benefit rather than a misfortune, and that every true philosopher ought to prefer death to life, assuming it to supervene without his own act &mdash; suicide being forbidden by
the Gods. He is represented as &ldquo;placidus ore, intrepidus verbis; intempestivas suorum lacrimas coercens&rdquo; &mdash; to borrow a phrase from Tacitus&rsquo;s striking picture of the last hours
of the Emperor Otho.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_7" href="#Footnotev2_25_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> To see him thus undisturbed, and even welcoming his approaching end, somewhat hurts the feelings of
his assembled friends, who are in the deepest affliction at the certainty of so soon losing him. Sokrates undertakes to defend himself before them as he had done before the Dikasts; and to show good
grounds for his belief, that death is not a misfortune, but a benefit, to the philosopher.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_8" href="#Footnotev2_25_8"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Simmias and Keb&ecirc;s,
though at first not satisfied with the reasonings, are nevertheless reluctant to produce their doubts, from fear of mortifying him in his last moments: but Sokrates protests against such reluctance
as founded on a misconception of his existing frame of mind.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_9" href="#Footnotev2_25_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a> He is now the same man as he was before, and he calls upon
them to keep up the freedom of debate unimpaired.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_4" id="Sidenotev2_25_4"></a> Emphasis of Sokrates in insisting on freedom of debate, active exercise of reason, and independent judgment for each
reasoner.</span></p>

<p>Indeed this freedom of debate and fulness of search &mdash; the paramount value of &ldquo;reasoned truth&rdquo; &mdash; the necessity of keeping up the force of individual reason by constant
argumentative exercise &mdash; and the right of independent <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page380" id="v2page380"></a>380</span>judgment for hearer as well as speaker &mdash; stand emphatically
proclaimed in these last words of the dying philosopher. He does not announce the immortality of the soul as a dogma of imperative orthodoxy; which men, whether satisfied with the proofs or not, must
believe, or must make profession of believing, on pain of being shunned as a moral pestilence, and disqualified from giving testimony in a court of justice. He sets forth his own conviction, with the
grounds on which he adopts it. But he expressly recognises the existence of dissentient opinions: he invites his companions to bring forward every objection: he disclaims all special purpose of
impressing his own conclusions upon their minds: nay, he expressly warns them not to be biassed by their personal sympathies, then wound up to the highest pitch, towards himself. He entreats them to
preserve themselves from becoming tinged with <i>misology</i>, or the hatred of free argumentative discussion: and he ascribes this mental vice to the early habit of easy, uninquiring, implicit,
belief: since a man thus ready of faith, embracing opinions without any discriminative test, presently finds himself driven to abandon one opinion after another, until at last he mistrusts all
opinions, and hates the process of discussing them, laying the blame upon philosophy instead of upon his own intellect.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_10" href="#Footnotev2_25_10"><span class=

<p>&ldquo;For myself&rdquo; (says Sokrates) &ldquo;I fear that in these my last hours I depart from the true spirit of philosophy &mdash; like unschooled men, who, when in debate, think scarcely at
all how the real question stands, but care only to make their own views triumphant in the minds of the auditors. Between them and me there is only thus much of difference. I regard it as a matter of
secondary consequence, whether my conclusions appear true to my hearers; but I shall do my best to make them appear as much as possible <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page381" id="v2page381">

hours: moreover my error will not continue with me &mdash; which would have been a real misfortune &mdash; but will be extinguished very shortly. Such is the frame of mind, Simmias and Keb&ecirc;s,
with which I approach the debate. Do you follow my advice: take little thought of Sokrates, but take much more thought of the truth. If I appear to you to affirm any thing truly, assent to me: but if
not, oppose me with all your powers of reasoning: Be on your guard lest, through earnest zeal, I should deceive alike myself and you, and should leave the sting in you, like a bee, at this hour of
departure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a remarkable passage, as illustrating the spirit and purpose of Platonic dialogues. In my preceding Chapters, I have already shown, that it is no part of the aim of Sokrates to thrust
dogmas of his own into other men&rsquo;s minds as articles of faith. But then, most of these Chapters have dwelt upon Dialogues of Search, in which Sokrates has appeared as an interrogator, or
enquirer jointly with others: scrutinising their opinions, but disclaiming knowledge or opinions of his own. Here, however, in the Ph&aelig;don, the case is altogether different. Sokrates is depicted
as having not only an affirmative opinion, but even strong conviction, on a subject of great moment: which conviction, moreover, he is especially desirous of preserving unimpaired, during his few
remaining hours of life. Yet even here, he manifests no anxiety to get that conviction into the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page382" id="v2page382"></a>382</span>minds of his friends, except as
a result of their own independent scrutiny and self-working reason. Not only he does not attempt to terrify them into believing, by menace of evil consequences if they do not &mdash; but he
repudiates pointedly even the gentler machinery of conversion, which might work upon their minds through attachment to himself and reverence for his authority. His devotion is to &ldquo;reasoned
truth&rdquo;: he challenges his friends to the fullest scrutiny by their own independent reason: he recognises the sentence which they pronounce afterwards as valid <i>for them</i>, whether
concurrent with himself or adverse. Their reason is for them, what his reason is for him: requiring, both alike (as Sokrates here proclaims), to be stimulated as well as controlled by all-searching
debate &mdash; but postulating equal liberty of final decision for each one of the debaters. The stress laid by Plato upon the full liberty of dissenting reason, essential to philosophical debate
&mdash; is one of the most memorable characteristics of the Ph&aelig;don. When we come to the treatise De Legibus (where Sokrates does not appear), we shall find a totally opposite view of sentiment.
In the tenth book of that treatise Plato enforces the rigid censorship of an orthodox persecutor, who makes his own reason binding and compulsory on all.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_7" id="Sidenotev2_25_7"></a> Ph&aelig;don and Symposion &mdash; points of analogy and contrast.</span></p>

<p>The natural counterpart and antithesis to the Ph&aelig;don, is found in the Symposion.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_12" href="#Footnotev2_25_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a> In both, the personality of
Sokrates stands out with peculiar force: in the one, he is in the fulness of life and enjoyment, along with festive comrades &mdash; in the other, he is on the verge of approaching death, surrounded
by companions in deep affliction. The point common to both, is, the perfect self-command of Sokrates under a diversity of trying circumstances. In the Symposion, we read of him as triumphing over
heat, cold, fatigue, danger, amorous temptation, unmeasured potations of wine, &amp;c.:<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_13" href="#Footnotev2_25_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> <span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page383" id="v2page383"></a>383</span>in the Ph&aelig;don, we discover him rising superior to the fear of death, and to the contagion of an afflicted company around him. Still, his resolute
volition is occasionally overpowered by fits of absorbing meditation, which seize him at moments sudden and unaccountable, and chain him to the spot for a long time. There is moreover, in both
dialogues, a streak of eccentricity in his character, which belongs to what Plato calls the philosophical inspiration and madness, rising above the measure of human temperance and prudence.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_25_14" href="#Footnotev2_25_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> The Ph&aelig;don depicts in Sokrates the same intense love of philosophy and dialectic debate, as the Symposion and
Ph&aelig;drus: but it makes no allusion to that personal attachment, and passionate admiration of youthful beauty, with which, according to those two dialogues, the mental fermentation of the
philosophical aspirant is asserted to begin.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_15" href="#Footnotev2_25_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a> Sokrates in the Ph&aelig;don describes the initial steps whereby he had
been led to philosophical study:<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_16" href="#Footnotev2_25_16"><span class="sp">16</span></a> but the process is one purely intellectual, without reference to personal converse
with beloved companions, as a necessity of the case. His discourse is that of a man on the point of death &mdash; &ldquo;abruptis vit&aelig; blandimentis&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_17" href=
"#Footnotev2_25_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> &mdash; and he already looks upon his body, not as furnishing the means of action and as requiring only to be trained by gymnastic discipline (as it
appears in the Republic), but as an importunate and depraving companion, of which he is glad to get rid: so that the ethereal substance of the soul may be left to its free expansion and fellowship
with the intelligible world, apart from sense and its solicitations.</p>

between soul and body.</span></p>

<p>We have here one peculiarity of the Ph&aelig;don, whereby it stands distinguished both from the Republic and the Tim&aelig;us. The antithesis on which it dwells is that of <span class="pagenum"><a
name="v2page384" id="v2page384"></a>384</span>the soul or mind, on one hand &mdash; the body on the other. The soul or mind is spoken of as one and indivisible: as if it were an inmate unworthily
lodged or imprisoned in the body. It is not distributed into distinct parts, kinds, or varieties: no mention is made of that tripartite distribution which is so much insisted on in the Republic and
Tim&aelig;us:&mdash; the rational or intellectual (encephalic) soul, located in the head &mdash; the courageous or passionate (thoracic), between the neck and the diaphragm &mdash; the appetitive
(abdominal), between the diaphragm and the navel. In the Ph&aelig;don, the soul is noted as the seat of reason, intellect, the love of wisdom or knowledge, exclusively: all that belongs to passion
and appetite, is put to account of the body:<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_18" href="#Footnotev2_25_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> this is distinctly contrary to the Phil&ecirc;bus, in which dialogue
Sokrates affirms that desire or appetite cannot belong to the body, but belongs only to the soul. In Ph&aelig;don, nothing is said about the location of the rational soul, in the head, &mdash; nor
about the analogy between its rotations in the cranium and the celestial rotations (a doctrine which we read both in the Tim&aelig;us and in the Republic): on the contrary, the soul is affirmed to
have lost, through its conjunction with the body, that wisdom or knowledge which it possessed during its state of pre-existence, while completely apart from the body, and while in commerce with those
invisible Ideas to which its own separate nature was cognate.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_19" href="#Footnotev2_25_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> That controul which in the Republic is exercised by the
rational soul over the passionate and appetitive souls, is in the Ph&aelig;don exercised (though imperfectly) by the one and only soul over the body.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_20" href=
"#Footnotev2_25_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> In the Republic and Tim&aelig;us, the soul is a tripartite aggregate, a community of parts, a compound: in the Ph&aelig;don, Sokrates asserts it to
be uncompounded, making this fact a point in his argument.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_21" href="#Footnotev2_25_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a> Again, in the Ph&aelig;don, the soul is pronounced to be
essentially uniform and incapable of change: as such, it is placed in antithesis with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page385" id="v2page385"></a>385</span>body, which is perpetually changing:
while we read, on the contrary, in the Symposion, that soul and body alike are in a constant and unremitting variation, neither one nor the other ever continuing in the same condition.<a name=

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_9" id="Sidenotev2_25_9"></a> Different doctrines of Plato about the soul. Whether all the three souls are immortal, or the rational soul
alone.</span></p>

<p>The difference which I have here noted shows how Plato modified his doctrine to suit the purpose of each dialogue. The tripartite soul would have been found inconvenient in the Ph&aelig;don, where
the argument required that soul and body should be as sharply distinguished as possible. Assuming passion and appetite to be attributes belonging to the soul, as well as reason &mdash; Sokrates will
not shake them off when he becomes divorced from the body. He believes and expects that the post-existence of the soul will be, as its pre-existence has been, a rational existence &mdash; a life of
intellectual contemplation and commerce with the eternal Ideas: in this there is no place for passion and appetite, which grow out of its conjunction with the body. The soul here represents Reason
and Intellect, in commerce with their correlates, the objective Entia Rationis: the body represents passion and appetite as well as sense, in implication with their correlates, the objects of
sensible perception.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_23" href="#Footnotev2_25_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a> Such is the doctrine of the Ph&aelig;don; but Plato is not always consistent with himself on the
point. His ancient as well as his modern commentators are not agreed, whether, when he vindicated the immortality of the soul, he meant to speak of the rational soul only, or of the aggregate soul
with its three parts as above described. There are passages which countenance both suppositions.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_24" href="#Footnotev2_25_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> Plato seems to have
leaned sometimes to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page386" id="v2page386"></a>386</span>one view, sometimes to the other: besides which, the view taken in the Ph&aelig;don is a third,
different from both &mdash; <i>viz.</i>: That the two non-rational souls, the passionate and appetitive, are not recognised as existing.</p>

<p>This subject is handled in an instructive Dissertation of K. F. Hermann &mdash; De Partibus Anim&aelig; Immortalibus secundum Platonem &mdash; delivered at G&ouml;ttingen in the winter Session,
1850-1851. He inclines to the belief that Plato intended to represent only the rational soul as immortal, and the other two souls as mortal (p. 9). But the passages which he produces are quite
sufficient to show, that Plato sometimes held one language, sometimes the other; and that Galen, who wrote an express treatise (now lost) to prove that Plato was inconsistent with himself in respect
to the soul, might have produced good reasons for his opinion. The &ldquo;inconstantia Platonis&rdquo; (Cicero, Nat. Deor. i. 12) must be admitted here as on other matters. We must take the different
arguments and doctrines of Plato as we find them in their respective places. Hermann (p. 4) says about the commentators &mdash; &ldquo;De irrationali anim&acirc;, alii ancipites h&aelig;serunt, alii
claris verbis mortalem pr&aelig;dicarunt: quumque Neoplatonic&aelig; sect&aelig; principes, Numenius et Plotinus, non modo brutorum, sed ne plantarum quidem, animas immortalitate privare ausi sunt,
&mdash; mox insequentes in alia omnia digressi aut plane perire irrationales partes affirmarunt, aut medi&acirc; qu&acirc;dam vi&acirc; ingressi, quamvis corporum fato exemptis, mortalitatem tamen et
ipsi tribuerunt.&rdquo; It appears that the divergence of opinion on this subject began as early as Xenokrates and Speusippus &mdash; see Olympiodorus, Scholia in Ph&aelig;donem, &sect; 175. The
large construction adopted by Numenius and Plotinus is completely borne out by a passage in the Ph&aelig;don, p. 70 E.</p>

<p>I must here remark that Hermann does not note the full extent of discrepancy between the Ph&aelig;don and Plato&rsquo;s other dialogues, consisting in this &mdash; That in the Ph&aelig;don, Plato
suppresses all mention of the two non-rational souls, the passionate and appetitive: insomuch that if we had only the Ph&aelig;don remaining, we should not have known that he had ever affirmed the
triple partition of the soul, or the co-existence of the three souls.</p>

<p>I transcribe an interesting passage from M. Deg&eacute;rando, respecting the belief in different varieties of soul, and partial immortality.</p>

<p>Deg&eacute;rando &mdash; Histoire Compar&eacute;e des Syst&egrave;mes de Philosophie, vol. i. p. 213.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Les habitans du Thibet, du Gr&ouml;enland, du nord de l&rsquo;Am&eacute;rique admettent deux &acirc;mes: les Car&auml;ibes en admettent trois, dont une, disent-ils, celle qui habite dans la
t&ecirc;te, remonte seule au pays des &acirc;mes. Les habitans du Gr&ouml;enland croient d&rsquo;ailleurs les &acirc;mes des hommes semblables au principe de la vie des animaux: ils supposent que les

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_10" id="Sidenotev2_25_10"></a> The life and character of a philosopher is a constant struggle to emancipate his soul from his body. Death alone
enables him to do this completely.</span></p>

<p>The philosopher (contends Sokrates) ought to rejoice when death comes to sever his soul altogether from his body: because he is, throughout all his life, struggling to sever himself from the
passions, appetites, impulses and aspirations, which grow out of the body; and to withdraw himself from the perceptions of the corporeal senses, which teach no truth, and lead only to deceit or
confusion: He is constantly attempting to do what the body hinders him from doing completely &mdash; to prosecute pure mental contemplation, as the only way of arriving at truth: to look at essences
or things in themselves, by means of his mind or soul in itself apart from the body.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_25" href="#Footnotev2_25_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a> Until his mind be purified from
all association with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page387" id="v2page387"></a>387</span>body, it cannot be brought into contact with pure essence, nor can his aspirations for knowledge be
satisfied.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_26" href="#Footnotev2_25_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> Hence his whole life is really a training or approximative practice for death, which alone will enable him
to realise such aspirations.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_27" href="#Footnotev2_25_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> Knowledge or wisdom is the only money in which he computes, and which he seeks to
receive in payment.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_28" href="#Footnotev2_25_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a> He is not courageous or temperate in the ordinary sense: for the courageous man, while holding
death to be a great evil, braves it from fear of greater evils &mdash; and the temperate man abstains from various pleasures, because they either shut him out from greater pleasures, or entail upon
him disease and poverty. The philosopher is courageous and temperate, but from a different motive: his philosophy purifies him from all these sensibilities, and makes him indifferent to all the
pleasures and pains arising from the body: each of which, in proportion to its intensity, corrupts his perception of truth and falsehood, and misguides him in the search for wisdom or knowledge.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_25_29" href="#Footnotev2_25_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> While in the body, he feels imprisoned, unable to look for knowledge except through a narrow grating and by the
deceptive media of sense. From this durance philosophy partially liberates him, &mdash; purifying his mind, like the Orphic or Dionysiac religious mysteries, from the contagion of body<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_25_30" href="#Footnotev2_25_30"><span class="sp">30</span></a> and sense: disengaging it, as far as may be during life, from sympathy with the body: and translating it out of the world of
sense, uncertainty, and mere opinion, into the invisible region of truth and knowledge. If such purification has been fully achieved, the mind of the philosopher is at the moment of death thoroughly
severed from the body, and passes clean away by itself, into commerce with the intelligible Entities or realities.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_12" id="Sidenotev2_25_12"></a> Special privilege claimed for philosophers in the Ph&aelig;don apart from the virtuous men who are not
philosophers.</span></p>

<p>Such is the creed which Sokrates announces to his friends in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page389" id="v2page389"></a>389</span>the Ph&aelig;don, as supplying good reason for the readiness and
satisfaction with which he welcomes death. It is upon the antithesis between soul (or mind) and body, that the main stress is laid. The partnership between the two is represented as the radical cause
of mischief: and the only true relief to the soul consists in breaking up the partnership altogether, so as to attain a distinct, disembodied, existence. Conformably to this doctrine, the line is
chiefly drawn between the philosopher, and the multitude who are not philosophers &mdash; not between good and bad agents, when the good agents are not philosophers. This last distinction is indeed
noticed, but is kept subordinate. The unphilosophical man of social goodness is allowed to pass after death into the body of a bee, or an ant, instead of that of a kite or ass;<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_25_35" href="#Footnotev2_25_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> but he does not attain the privilege of dissolving connection altogether with body. Moreover the distinction is one not
easily traceable: since Sokrates<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_36" href="#Footnotev2_25_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> expressly remarks that the large majority of mankind are middling persons, neither
good nor bad in any marked degree. Philosophers stand in a category by themselves: apart from the virtuous citizens, as well as from the middling and the vicious. Their appetites and ambition are
indeed deadened, so that they agree with the virtuous in abstaining from injustice: but this is not their characteristic feature. Philosophy is asserted to impart to them a special purification, like
that of the Orphic mysteries to the initiated: detaching the soul from both the body and the world of sense, except in so far as is indispensable for purposes of life: replunging the soul, as much as
possible, in the other world of intelligible essences, real forms or Ideas, which are its own natural kindred and antecedent companions. The process whereby this is accomplished is intellectual
rather than ethical. It is the process of learning, or (in the sense of Sokrates) the revival in the mind of those essences or Ideas with which it had been familiar during its anterior and separate
life: accompanied by the total abstinence from all other pleasures and temptations.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_37" href="#Footnotev2_25_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> Only by such love of learning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page390" id="v2page390"></a>390</span>which is identical with philosophy (&phi;&iota;&lambda;&#972;&sigma;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&nu;,
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&theta;&#8050;&sigmaf;), is the mind rescued from the ignorance and illusions unavoidable in the world of sense.</p>

asking for proof. Unabated interest of Sokrates in rational debate.</span></p>

<p>In thus explaining his own creed, Sokrates announces a full conviction that the soul or mind is immortal, but he has not yet offered any proof of it: and Simmias as well as Keb&ecirc;s declare
themselves to stand in need of proof. Both of them however are reluctant to obtrude upon him any doubts. An opportunity is thus provided, that Sokrates may exhibit his undisturbed equanimity &mdash;
his unimpaired argumentative readiness &mdash; his keen anxiety not to relax the grasp of a subject until he has brought it to a satisfactory close &mdash; without the least reference to his speedily
approaching death. This last-mentioned anxiety is made manifest in a turn of the dialogue, remarkable both for dramatic pathos and for originality.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_38" href=

cannot be said to be produced at all. Simmias and Keb&ecirc;s are represented as Sokratic companions, partly Pythagoreans; desirous to find the doctrine true, yet ignorant of the proofs. Both of them
are earnest believers in the pre-existence of the soul, and in the objective reality of Ideas or intelligible essences. Simmias however adopts in part the opinion, not very clearly explained,
&ldquo;That the soul is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page391" id="v2page391"></a>391</span>harmony or mixture&rdquo;: which opinion Sokrates refutes, partly by some other arguments, partly by
pointing out that it is inconsistent with the supposition of the soul as pre-existent to the body, and that Simmias must make his election between the two. Simmias elects without hesitation, in
favour of the pre-existence: which he affirms to be demonstrable upon premisses or assumptions perfectly worthy of trust: while the alleged harmony is at best only a probable analogy, not certified
by conclusive reasons.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_40" href="#Footnotev2_25_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> Keb&ecirc;s again, while admitting that the soul existed before its conjunction with the
present body, and that it is sufficiently durable to last through conjunction with many different bodies &mdash; still expresses his apprehension that though durable, it is not eternal. Accordingly,
no man can be sure that his present body is not the last with which his soul is destined to be linked; so that immediately on his death, it will pass away into nothing. The opinion of Keb&ecirc;s is
remarkable, inasmuch as it shows how constantly the metempsychosis, or transition of the soul from one body to another, was included in all the varieties of ancient speculation on this subject.<a

<p>The following abstract is intended only to exhibit the train of thought and argument pursued by Sokrates; not adhering to the exact words, nor even preserving the interlocutory form. I could not

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_16" id="Sidenotev2_25_16"></a> First doctrine of Sokrates as to cause. Reasons why he rejected it.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You compel me (says Sokrates) to discuss thoroughly the cause of generation and destruction.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_43" href="#Footnotev2_25_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> I will tell
you, if you like, my own successive impressions on these <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page392" id="v2page392"></a>392</span>subjects. When young, I was amazingly eager for that kind of knowledge
which people call the investigation of Nature. I thought it matter of pride to know the causes of every thing &mdash; through what every thing is either generated, or destroyed, or continues to
exist. I puzzled myself much to discover first of all such matters as these &mdash; Is it a certain putrefaction of the Hot and the Cold in the system (as some say), which brings about the
nourishment of animals? Is it the blood through which we think &mdash; or air, or fire? Or is it neither one nor the other, but the brain, which affords to us sensations of sight, hearing, and smell,
out of which memory and opinion are generated: then, by a like process, knowledge is generated out of opinion and memory when permanently fixed?<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_44" href=
"#Footnotev2_25_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a> I tried to understand destructions as well as generations, celestial as well as terrestrial phenomena. But I accomplished nothing, and ended by
fancying myself utterly unfit for the enquiry. Nay &mdash; I even lost all the knowledge of that which I had before believed myself to understand. For example &mdash; From what cause does a man grow?
At first, I had looked upon this as evident &mdash; that it was through eating and drinking: flesh being thereby added to his flesh, bone to his bone, &amp;c. So too, when a tall and a short man were
standing together, it appeared to me that the former was taller than the latter by the head &mdash; that ten were more than eight because two were added to them<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_45" href=
"#Footnotev2_25_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a> &mdash; that a rod of two cubits was greater than a rod of one cubit, because it projected beyond it by a half. Now &mdash; I am satisfied that I do
not know the cause of any of these matters. I cannot explain why, when one is added to one, such addition makes them two; since in their separated state each was one. In this case, it is
approximation or conjunction which is said to make the two: in another case, the opposite cause, <i>disjunction</i>, is said also to make two &mdash; when one body is bisected.<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_25_46" href="#Footnotev2_25_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> How two opposite causes can produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page393" id="v2page393"></a>393</span> the same effect
&mdash; and how either conjunction or disjunction can produce two, where there were not two before &mdash; I do not understand. In fact, I could not explain to myself, by this method of research, the
generation, or destruction, or existence, of any thing; and I looked out for some other method.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_17" id="Sidenotev2_25_17"></a> Second doctrine. Hopes raised by the treatise of Anaxagoras.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was at this time that I heard a man reading out of a book, which he told me was the work of Anaxagoras, the affirmation that Nous (Reason, Intelligence) was the regulator and cause of
all things. I felt great satisfaction in this cause; and I was convinced, that if such were the fact, Reason would ordain every thing for the best: so that if I wanted to find out the cause of any
generation, or destruction, or existence, I had only to enquire in what manner it was best that such generation or destruction should take place. Thus a man was only required to know, both respecting
himself and respecting other things, what was the best: which knowledge, however, implied that he must also know what was worse &mdash; the knowledge of the one and of the other going together.<a
name="FnAnchorv2_25_47" href="#Footnotev2_25_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> I thought I had thus found a master quite to my taste, who would tell me, first whether the earth was a disk or a
sphere, and would proceed to explain the cause and the necessity why it must be so, by showing me how such arrangement was the best: next, if he said that the earth was in the centre, would proceed
to show that it was best that the earth should be in the centre. Respecting the Sun, Moon, and Stars, I expected to hear the like explanation of their movements, rotations, and other phenomena: that
is, how it was better that each should do and suffer exactly what the facts show. I never imagined that Anaxagoras, while affirming that they were regulated by Reason, would put upon them any other
cause than this &mdash; that it was best for them to be exactly as they are. I presumed that, when giving account of the cause, both of each severally and all collectively, he would do it by setting
forth what was best for each severally and for all in common. Such <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page394" id="v2page394"></a>394</span>was my hope, and I would not have sold it for a large
price.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_48" href="#Footnotev2_25_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> I took up eagerly the book of Anaxagoras, and read it as quickly as I could, that I might at once come to the
knowledge of the better and worse.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_18" id="Sidenotev2_25_18"></a> Disappointment because Anaxagoras did not follow out the optimistic principle into detail. Distinction between causes
efficient and causes co-efficient.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Great indeed was my disappointment when, as I proceeded with the perusal, I discovered that the author never employed Reason at all, nor assigned any causes calculated to regulate things
generally: that the causes which he indicated were, air, &aelig;ther, water, and many other strange agencies. The case seemed to me the same as if any one, while announcing that Sokrates acts in all
circumstances by reason, should next attempt to assign the causes of each of my proceedings severally:<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_49" href="#Footnotev2_25_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> As if
he affirmed, for example, that the cause why I am now sitting here is, that my body is composed of bones and ligaments &mdash; that my bones are hard, and are held apart by commissures, and my
ligaments such as to contract and relax, clothing the bones along with the flesh and the skin which keeps them together &mdash; that when the bones are lifted up at their points of junction, the
contraction and relaxation of the ligaments makes me able to bend my limbs &mdash; and that this is the reason why I am now seated here in my present crumpled attitude: or again &mdash; as if,
concerning the fact of my present conversation with you, he were to point to other causes of a like character &mdash; varieties of speech, air, and hearing, with numerous other similar facts &mdash;
omitting all the while to notice the true causes, <i>viz.</i><a name="FnAnchorv2_25_50" href="#Footnotev2_25_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> &mdash; That inasmuch as the Athenians have deemed it
best to condemn me, for that reason I too have deemed it best and most righteous to remain sitting here and to undergo the sentence which they impose. For, by the Dog, these bones and ligaments would
have been long ago carried <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page395" id="v2page395"></a>395</span>away to Thebes or Megara, by my judgment of what is best &mdash; if I had not deemed it more
righteous and honourable to stay and affront my imposed sentence, rather than to run away. It is altogether absurd to call such agencies by the name of <i>causes</i>. Certainly, if a man affirms that
unless I possessed such joints and ligaments and other members as now belong to me, I should not be able to execute what I have determined on, he will state no more than the truth. But to say that
these are the causes why I, a rational agent, do what I am now doing, instead of saying that I do it from my choice of what is best &mdash; this would be great carelessness of speech: implying that a
man cannot see the distinction between that which is the cause in reality, and that without which the cause can never be a cause.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_51" href="#Footnotev2_25_51"><span class=
"sp">51</span></a> It is this last which most men, groping as it were in the dark, call by a wrong name, as if it were itself the cause. Thus one man affirms that the earth is kept stationary in its
place by the rotation of the heaven around it: another contends that the air underneath supports the earth, like a pedestal sustaining a broad kneading-trough: but none of them ever look out for a
force such as this &mdash; That all these things now occupy that position which it is best that they should occupy. These enquirers set no great value upon this last-mentioned force, believing that
they can find some other Atlas stronger, more everlasting, and more capable of holding all things together: they think that the Good and the Becoming have no power of binding or holding together any
thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, it is this sort of cause which I would gladly put myself under any one&rsquo;s teaching to learn. But I could neither find any teacher, nor make any way by myself. Having failed in
this quarter, I took the second best course, and struck into a new path in search of causes.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_52" href="#Footnotev2_25_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> Fatigued with studying

attributes.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I now assumed the separate and real existence of Ideas by themselves &mdash; The Good in itself or the Self-Good, Self-Beautiful, Great, and all such others. Look what follows next upon
this assumption. If any thing else be beautiful, besides the Self-Beautiful, that other thing can only be beautiful because it partakes of the Self-Beautiful: and the same with regard to other
similar Ideas. This is the only cause that I can accept: I do not understand those other ingenious causes which I hear mentioned.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_55" href="#Footnotev2_25_55"><span class=
"sp">55</span></a> When any one tells me that a thing is beautiful because it has a showy colour or figure, I pay no attention to him, but adhere simply to my own affirmation, that nothing else
causes it to be beautiful, except the presence or participation of the Self-Beautiful. In what way such participation may take place, I cannot positively determine. But I feel confident in affirming
that it does take place: that things which are beautiful, become so by partaking in the Self-Beautiful; things which are great or little, by partaking in Greatness or Littleness. If I am told that
one man is taller than another by the head, and that this other is shorter than the first by the very same (by the head), I should not admit the proposition, but should repeat emphatically my own
creed, &mdash; That whatever is greater than another is greater by nothing else <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page397" id="v2page397"></a>397</span>except by Greatness and through Greatness
&mdash; whatever is less than another is less only by Littleness and through Littleness. For I should fear to be entangled in a contradiction, if I affirmed that the greater man was greater and the
lesser man less by the head &mdash; First, in saying that the greater was greater and that the lesser was less, by the very same &mdash; Next, in saying that the greater man was greater by the head,
which is itself small: it being absurd to maintain that a man is great by something small.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_56" href="#Footnotev2_25_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> Again, I should not say
that ten is more than eight by two, and that this was the cause of its excess;<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_57" href="#Footnotev2_25_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> my doctrine is, that ten is more than
eight by Multitude and through Multitude: so the rod of two cubits is greater than that of one, not by half, but by Greatness. Again, when One is placed alongside of One, &mdash; or when one is
bisected &mdash; I should take care not to affirm, that in the first case the juxtaposition, in the last case the bisection, was the cause why it became two.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_58" href=
"#Footnotev2_25_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> I proclaim loudly that I know no other cause for its becoming two except participation in the essence of the Dyad. What is to become two, must
partake of the Dyad: what is to become one, of the Monad. I leave to wiser men than me these juxtapositions and bisections and other such refinements: I remain entrenched within the safe ground of my
own assumption or hypothesis (the reality of these <span class="correction" title="amended from intellegible">intelligible</span> and eternal Ideas).</p>

<p>The exposition here given by Sokrates of successive intellectual tentatives (whether of Sokrates or Plato, or partly one, partly the other), and the reasoning embodied therein, is represented as
welcomed with emphatic assent and approbation by all his fellow-dialogists.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_60" href="#Footnotev2_25_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> It deserves attention on many grounds. It
illustrates instructively some of the speculative points of view, and speculative transitions, suggesting themselves to an inquisitive intellect of that day.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_23" id="Sidenotev2_25_23"></a> The philosophical changes in Sokrates all turned upon different views as to a true cause.</span></p>

<p>If we are to take that which precedes as a description of the philosophical changes of Plato himself, it differs materially from Aristotle: for no allusion is here made to the intercourse of Plato
with Kratylus and other advocates of the doctrines of Herakleitus: which intercourse is mentioned by Aristotle<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_61" href="#Footnotev2_25_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> as
having greatly influenced the early speculations of Plato. Sokrates describes three different phases of his (or Plato&rsquo;s) speculative point of view: all turning upon different conceptions of
what constituted a true Cause. His first belief on the subject was, that which he entertained before he entered on physical and physiological investigations. It seemed natural to him that eating and
drinking should be the cause why a young man grew taller: new bone and new flesh was added out of the food. So again, when a tall man appeared standing near to a short man, the former was tall by the
head, or because of the head: ten were more than eight, because two were added on: <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page399" id="v2page399"></a>399</span>the measure of two cubits was greater than
that of one cubit, because it stretched beyond by one half. When one object was added on to another, the addition was the cause why they became two: when one object was bisected, this bisection was
the cause why the one became two.</p>

</div>

<p>This was his first conception of a true Cause, which for the time thoroughly satisfied him. But when he came to investigate physiology, he could not follow out the same conception of Cause, so as
to apply it to more novel and complicated problems; and he became dissatisfied with it altogether, even in regard to questions on which he had before been convinced. New difficulties suggested
themselves to him. How can the two objects, which when separate were each one, be made <i>two</i>, by the fact that they are brought together? What alteration has happened in their nature? Then
again, how can the very same fact, the change from one to two, be produced by two causes perfectly contrary to each other &mdash; in the first case, by juxtaposition &mdash; in the last case, by
bisection?<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_62" href="#Footnotev2_25_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_24" id="Sidenotev2_25_24"></a> Problems and difficulties of which Sokrates first sought solution.</span></p>

<p>That which is interesting here to note, is the sort of Cause which first gave satisfaction to the speculative mind of Sokrates. In the instance of the growing youth, he notes two distinct facts,
the earliest of which is (assuming certain other facts as accompanying conditions) the cause of the latest. But in most of the other instances, the fact is one which does not admit of explanation.
Comparisons of eight men with ten men, of a yard with half a yard, of a tall man with a short man, are mental appreciations, beliefs, affirmations, not capable of being farther explained or accounted
for: if any one disputes your affirmation, you prove it to him, by placing him in a situation to make the comparison for himself, or to go through the computation which establishes the truth of what
you affirm. It is not the juxtaposition of eight men which makes them to be eight (they were so just as much when separated by ever so wide an interval): though it may dispose or enable the spectator
to count them as eight. We may count the yard measure (whether actually bisected or not), either as one yard, or as two half yards, or as three feet, or thirty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name=
"v2page400" id="v2page400"></a>400</span> inches. Whether it be one, or two, or three, depends upon the substantive which we choose to attach to the numeral, or upon the comparison which we make (the
unit which we select) on the particular occasion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_25" id="Sidenotev2_25_25"></a> Expectations entertained by Sokrates from the treatise of Anaxagoras. His disappointment. His distinction between
causes and co-efficients.</span></p>

<p>With this description of Cause Sokrates grew dissatisfied when he extended his enquiries into physical and physiological problems. Is it the blood, or air, or fire, whereby we think? and such like
questions. Such enquiries &mdash; into the physical conditions of mental phenomena &mdash; did really admit of some answer, affirmative, or negative. But Sokrates does not tell us how he proceeded in
seeking for an answer: he only says that he failed so completely, as even to be disabused of his supposed antecedent knowledge. He was in this perplexity when he first heard of the doctrine of
Anaxagoras. &ldquo;<i>Nous</i> or Reason is the regulator and the cause of all things.&rdquo; Sokrates interpreted this to mean (what it does not appear that Anaxagoras intended to assert)<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_25_63" href="#Footnotev2_25_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> that the Kosmos was an animal or person<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_64" href="#Footnotev2_25_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a>
having mind or Reason analogous to his own: that this Reason was an agent invested with full power and perpetually operative, so as to regulate in the best manner all the phenomena of the Kosmos; and
that the general cause to be assigned for every thing was one and the same &mdash; &ldquo;It is best thus&rdquo;; requiring that in each particular case you should show <i>how</i> it was for the
best. Sokrates took the type of Reason from his own volition and movements; supposing that all the agencies in the Kosmos were stimulated or checked by cosmical Reason for her purposes, as he himself
put in motion his own bodily members. This conception of Cause, borrowed from the analogy of his own rational volition, appeared to Sokrates very captivating, though it had not been his own first
conception. But he found that Anaxagoras, though proclaiming the doctrine as a principium or initiatory influence, did not make applications of it in detail; but assigned as causes, in most of the
particular cases, those agencies which Sokrates considered to be subordinate and instrumental, as his own muscles were to his own volition. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page401" id="v2page401">
</a>401</span>Sokrates will not allow such agencies to be called Causes: he says that they are only co-efficients indispensable to the efficacy of the single and exclusive Cause &mdash; Reason. But
he tells us himself that most enquirers considered them as Causes; and that Anaxagoras himself produced them as such. Moreover we shall see Plato himself in the Tim&aelig;us, while he repeats this
same distinction between Causes Efficient and Causes Co-efficient &mdash; yet treats these latter as Causes also, though inferior in regularity and precision to the Demiurgic Nous.<a name=

Aristophanes and others imputed to Sokrates.</span></p>

<p>In truth, the complaint which Sokrates here raises against Anaxagoras &mdash; that he assigned celestial Rotation as the cause of phenomena, in place of a quasi-human Reason &mdash; is just the
same as that which Aristophanes in the Clouds advances against Sokrates himself.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_66" href="#Footnotev2_25_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> The comic poet accuses Sokrates of
displacing Zeus to make room for Dinos or Rotation. According to the popular religious belief, all or most of the agencies in Nature were personified, or supposed to be carried on by persons &mdash;
Gods, Goddesses, D&aelig;mons, Nymphs, &amp;c., which army of independent agents were conceived, by some thinkers, as more or less systematised and <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page402" id=
"v2page402"></a>402</span>consolidated under the central authority of the Kosmos itself. The causes of natural phenomena, especially of the grand and terrible phenomena, were supposed agents,
conceived after the model of man, and assumed to be endowed with volition, force, affections, antipathies, &amp;c.: some of them visible, such as Helios, Sel&ecirc;n&ecirc;, the Stars; others
generally invisible, though showing themselves whenever it specially pleased them.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_67" href="#Footnotev2_25_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> Sokrates, as we see by the
Platonic Apology, was believed by his countrymen to deny these animated agencies, and to substitute instead of them inanimate forces, not put in motion by the quasi-human attributes of reason,
feeling and volition. The Sokrates in the Platonic Ph&aelig;don, taken at this second stage of his speculative wanderings, not only disclaims such a doctrine, but protests against it. He recognises
no cause except a Nous or Reason borrowed by analogy from that of which he was conscious within himself, choosing what was best for himself in every special situation.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_68" href=
"#Footnotev2_25_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a> He tells <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page403" id="v2page403"></a>403</span>us however that most of the contemporary philosophers dissented from
this point of view. To them, such inanimate agencies were the sole and real causes, in one or other of which they found what they thought a satisfactory explanation.</p>

like displeasure against the Cartesian theory of the vortices. Descartes recognised God as having originally established rotatory motion among the atoms, together with an equal, unvarying quantity of
motion: these two points being granted, Descartes considered that all cosmical facts and phenomena might be deduced from them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sur la philosophie de Descartes, Pascal &eacute;tait de son sentiment sur l&rsquo;automate; et n&rsquo;en &eacute;tait point sur la mati&egrave;re subtile, dont il se moquait fort. Mais il
ne pouvait souffrir sa mani&egrave;re d&rsquo;expliquer la formation de toutes choses; et il disait tr&egrave;s souvent, &mdash; Je ne puis pardonner &agrave; Descartes: il voudrait bien, dans toute

Dieu.&rdquo; (Pascal, Pens&eacute;es, ch. xi. p. 237, edition de Louandre, citation from Mademoiselle P&eacute;rier, Paris, 1854.)</p>

<p>Again, Lord Monboddo, in his Ancient Metaphysics (bk. ii. ch. 19, p. 276), cites these remarks of Plato and Aristotle on the deficiencies of Anaxagoras, and expresses the like censure himself
against the cosmical theories of Newton:&mdash; &ldquo;Sir Isaac puts me in mind of an ancient philosopher Anaxagoras, who maintained, as Sir Isaac does, that mind was the cause of all things; but
when he came to explain the particular ph&aelig;nomena of nature, instead of having recourse to mind, employed airs and &aelig;thers, subtle spirits and fluids, and I know not what &mdash; in short,
any thing rather than mind: a cause which he admitted to exist in the universe; but rather than employ it, had recourse to imaginary causes, of the existence of which he could give no proof. The
Tragic poets of old, when they could not otherwise untie the knot of their fable, brought down a god in a machine, who solved all difficulties: but such philosophers as Anaxagoras will not, even when
they cannot do better, employ <i>mind</i> or divinity. Our philosophers, since Sir Isaac&rsquo;s time, have gone on in the same track, and still, I think, farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Monboddo speaks with still greater asperity about the Cartesian theory, making a remark on it similar to what has been above cited from Pascal. (See his Dissertation on the Newtonian
Philosophy, Appendix to Ancient Metaphysics, pp. 498-499.)</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_25_68" id="Footnotev2_25_68"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_25_68">68</a></span> What Sokrates understands by the theory of Anaxagoras, is evident from
his language &mdash; Ph&aelig;don, pp. 98-99. He understands an indwelling cosmical Reason or Intelligence, deliberating and choosing, in each particular conjuncture, what was best for the Kosmos;
just as his own (Sokrates) Reason deliberated and chose what was best for him (&tau;&#8135; &tau;&omicron;&#8166; &beta;&epsilon;&lambda;&tau;&#943;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
&alpha;&#7985;&rho;&#941;&sigma;&epsilon;&iota;), in consequence of the previous determination of the Athenians to condemn and punish him.</p>

<p>This point deserves attention, because it is altogether different from Aristotle&rsquo;s conception of Nous or Reason in the Kosmos: in which he recognises no consciousness, no deliberation, no
choice, no reference to any special situation: but a constant, instinctive, undeliberating, movement towards Good as a determining End &mdash; <i>i.e.</i> towards the reproduction and perpetuation of
regular Forms.</p>

<p>Hegel, in his Geschichte der Philosophie (Part i. pp. 355, 368-369, 2nd edit.), has given very instructive remarks, in the spirit of the Aristotelian Realism, both upon the principle announced by
Anaxagoras, and upon the manner in which Anaxagoras is criticised by Sokrates in the Platonic Ph&aelig;don. Hegel observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Along with this principle (that of Anaxagoras) there comes in the recognition of an Intelligence, or of a self-determining agency which was wanting before. Herein we are not to imagine
thought, subjectively considered: when thought is spoken of, we are apt to revert to thought as it passes in our consciousness: but here, on the contrary, what is meant is, the Idea, considered
altogether objectively, or Intelligence as an effective agent: (N.B. <i>Intellectum</i>, or <i>Cogitatum</i> &mdash; not <i>Intellectio</i>, or <i>Cogitatio</i>, which would mean the conscious
process &mdash; see this distinction illustrated by Trendelenburg ad Aristot. De Anim&acirc;, i. 2, 5, p. 219: also Marbach, Gesch. der Phil. s. 54, 99 not. 2): as we say, that there is reason in the
world, or as we speak of Genera in nature, which are the Universal. The Genus Animal is the Essential of the Dog &mdash; it is the Dog himself: the laws of nature are her immanent Essence. Nature is
not formed from without, as men construct a table: the table is indeed constructed intelligently, but by an Intelligence extraneous to this wooden material. It is this extraneous form which we are
apt to think of as representing Intelligence, when we hear it talked of: but what is really meant is, the Universal &mdash; the immanent nature of the object itself. The &Nu;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf;
is not a thinking Being without, which has arranged the world: by such an interpretation the Idea of Anaxagoras would be quite perverted and deprived of all philosophical value. For to suppose an
individual, particular, Something without, is to descend into the region of phantasms and its dualism: what is called, a thinking Being, is not an Idea, but a Subject. Nevertheless, what is really
and truly Universal is not for that reason Abstract: its characteristic property, qu&acirc; Universal, is to determine in itself, by itself, and for itself, the particular accompaniments. While it
carries on this process of change, it maintains itself at the same time as the Universal, always the same; this is a portion of its self-determining efficiency.&rdquo; &mdash; What Hegel here adverts
to seems identical with that which Dr. Henry More calls an Emanative Cause (Immortality of the Soul, ch. vi. p. 18), &ldquo;the notion of a thing possible. An Emanative Effect is co-existent with the
very substance of that which is said to be the Cause thereof. That which <i>emanes</i>, if I may so speak, is the same in reality with its Emanative Cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Respecting the criticism of Sokrates upon Anaxagoras, Hegel has further acute remarks which are too long to cite (p. 368 seq.)</p>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_27" id="Sidenotev2_25_27"></a> The supposed theory of Anaxagoras cannot be carried out, either by Sokrates himself or any one else. Sokrates turns to
general words, and adopts the theory of ideas.</span></p>

<p>It is however singular, that Sokrates, after he has extolled Anaxagoras for enunciating a grand general cause, and has blamed him only for not making application of it in detail, proceeds to state
that neither he himself, nor any one else within his knowledge, could find the way of applying it, any more than Anaxagoras had done. If Anaxagoras had failed, no one else could do better. The facts
before Sokrates could not be reconciled, by any way that he could devise, with his assumed principle of rational directing force, or constant optimistic purpose, inherent in the Kosmos. Accordingly
he abandoned this track, and entered upon another: seeking a different sort of cause (&tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page404" id="v2page404">
</a>404</span>&alpha;&#7984;&tau;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8056; &epsilon;&#7990;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;), not by contemplation of things, but by propositions and ratiocinative discourse. He now
assumed as a principle an universal axiom or proposition, from which he proceeds to deduce consequences. The principle thus laid down is, That there exist substantial Ideas &mdash; universal Entia.
Each of these Ideas communicates or imparts its own nature to the particulars which bear the same name: and such communion or participation is the cause why they are what they are. The cause why
various objects are beautiful or great, is, because they partake of the Self-Beautiful or the Self-Great: the cause why they are two or three is, because they partake of the Dyad or the Triad.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_28" id="Sidenotev2_25_28"></a> Vague and dissentient meanings attached to the word Cause. That is a cause, to each man, which gives satisfaction to
his inquisitive feelings.</span></p>

<p>Here then we have a third stage or variety of belief, in the speculative mind of Sokrates, respecting Causes. The self-existent Ideas (&rdquo;propria Platonis supellex,&rdquo; to use the words of
Seneca<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_69" href="#Footnotev2_25_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a>) are postulated as Causes: and in this belief Sokrates at last finds satisfaction. But these Causative Ideas,
or Ideal Causes, though satisfactory to Plato, were accepted by scarcely any one else. They were transformed &mdash; seemingly even by Plato himself before his death, into Ideal Numbers, products of
the One implicated with Great and Little or the undefined Dyad &mdash; and still farther transformed by <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page405" id="v2page405"></a>405</span>his successors
Speusippus and Xenokrates: they were impugned in every way, and emphatically rejected, by Aristotle.</p>

<p>About this disposition, manifested by many philosophers, and in a particular manner by Plato, to &ldquo;embrace logical phantoms as real causes,&rdquo; I transcribe a good passage from
Malebranche.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Je me sens encore extr&ecirc;mement port&eacute; &agrave; dire que cette colonne est dure <i>par sa nature</i>; ou bien que les petits liens dont sont compos&eacute;s les corps durs, sont

et l&rsquo;autre est, la facilit&eacute; que j&rsquo;ai de prendre les natures abstraites et les id&eacute;es g&eacute;n&eacute;rales de logique, pour celles qui sont r&eacute;elles et
particuli&egrave;res: et je me souviens d&rsquo;avoir &eacute;t&eacute; plusieurs fois s&eacute;duit par ces deux principes d&rsquo;erreur.&rdquo; (Malebranche &mdash; Recherche de la

<p>The foregoing picture given by Sokrates of the wanderings of his mind (&tau;&#8048;&sigmaf; &#7952;&mu;&#8048;&sigmaf; &pi;&lambda;&#940;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;) in search of Causes, is interesting,
not only in reference to the Platonic age, but also to the process of speculation generally. Almost every one talks of a Cause as a word of the clearest meaning, familiar and understood by all
hearers. There are many who represent the Idea of Cause as simple, intuitive, self-originated, universal; one and the same in all minds. These philosophers consider the maxim that every phenomenon
must have a Cause &mdash; as self-evident, known <i>&agrave; priori</i> apart from experience: as something which no one can help believing as soon as it is stated to him.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_70"
href="#Footnotev2_25_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> The gropings of Sokrates are among the numerous facts which go to refute such a theory: or at least to show in what sense alone it can be
partially admitted. There is no fixed, positive, universal Idea, corresponding to the word Cause. There is a wide divergence, as to the question what a Cause really is, between different ages of the
same man (exemplified in the case of Sokrates): much more between different philosophers at one time and another. Plato complains of Anaxagoras and other philosophers for assigning as Causes that
which did not truly deserve the name: Aristotle also blames the defective conceptions of his predecessors (Plato included) on the same subject. If there be an intuitive idea corresponding to the word
Cause, it must be a different intuition in <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page406" id="v2page406"></a>406</span>Plato and Aristotle &mdash; in Plato himself at one age and at another age: in other
philosophers, different from both and from each other. The word is equivocal &mdash; &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&chi;&#8182;&sigmaf;
&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&nu;, in Aristotelian phrase &mdash; men use it familiarly, but vary much in the thing signified. <i>That</i> is a Cause, to each man, which
gives satisfaction to the inquisitive feelings &mdash; curiosity, anxious perplexity, speculative embarrassment of his own mind. Now doubtless these inquisitive feelings are natural and widespread:
they are emotions of our nature, which men seek (in some cases) to appease by some satisfactory hypothesis. That answer which affords satisfaction, looked at in one of its aspects, is called Cause;
Beginning or Principle &mdash; Element &mdash; represent other aspects of the same Qu&aelig;situm:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Several modern philosophers (especially Dr. Reid, On the Intell. Powers) have been at pains to illustrate that law of our nature which leads us to refer every change we perceive in the
universe to the operation of an efficient cause. This reference is not the result of reasoning, but necessarily accompanies the perception, so as to render it impossible for us to see the change,
without feeling a conviction of the operation of some cause by which it is produced; much in the same manner in which we find it impossible to conceive a sensation, without being impressed with a
belief of the existence of a sentient being. Hence I conceive it is that when we see two events constantly conjoined, we are led to associate the idea of causation or efficiency with the former, and
to refer to it that power or energy by which the change is produced; in consequence of which association we come to consider philosophy as the knowledge of efficient causes, and lose sight of the
operation of mind in producing the phenomena of nature. It is by an association somewhat similar that we connect our sensations of colour with the primary qualities of body. A moment&rsquo;s
reflection must satisfy any one that the sensation of colour can only reside in a mind.&hellip; In the same way we are led to associate with inanimate matter the ideas of power, force, energy,
causation, which are all attributes of mind, and can exist in a mind only.&rdquo;</p>

&mdash; What is a cause? revealed by the picture of Sokrates &mdash; no intuition to guide him.</span></p>

<p>When Sokrates here tells us that as a young man he felt anxious curiosity to know what the cause of every phenomenon was, it is plain that at this time he did not know what he was looking for:
that he proceeded only by successive steps of trial, doubt, discovered error, rejection: and that each trial was adapted to the then existing state of his own mind. The views of Anaxagoras he affirms
to have presented themselves to him as a new revelation: he then came to believe that the only true Cause was, a cosmical reason and volition like to that of which he was conscious in himself. Yet he
farther tells us, that others did not admit this Cause, but found other causes to satisfy them: that even Anaxagoras did not follow out his own general conception, but recognised Causes quite
unconnected with it: lastly, that neither could he (Sokrates) trace out the conception for himself.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_74" href="#Footnotev2_25_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> He was driven to
renounce it, and to turn to another sort of Cause &mdash; the hypothesis of self-existent Ideas, in which he then acquiesced. And this last hypothesis, again, was ultimately much modified in the mind
of Plato himself, as we know from Aristotle. All this shows that the Idea of Cause &mdash; far from being one and the same to all, like the feeling of uneasiness which prompts the search for it
&mdash; is complicated, diverse, relative, and modifiable.</p>

<div class="footnote">

from inability to pursue it, is substantially the same as what he lays down in the Phil&ecirc;bus, pp. 23 D, 27 A, 30 E.</p>

<p>In the Tim&aelig;us Plato assigns to Tim&aelig;us the task (to which Sokrates in the Ph&aelig;don had confessed himself incompetent) of following into detail the schemes and proceedings of the
Demiurgic or optimising &Nu;&omicron;&#8166;&sigmaf;. But he also assumes the &epsilon;&#7988;&delta;&eta; or Ideas as co-ordinate and essential conditions.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_30" id="Sidenotev2_25_30"></a> Different notions of Plato and Aristotle about causation, causes regular and irregular. Inductive theory of causation,
elaborated in modern times.</span></p>

<p>The last among the various revolutions which Sokrates represents himself to have undergone &mdash; the transition from designing and volitional agency of the Kosmos conceived as an animated
system, to the sovereignty of universal Ideas &mdash; is analogous to that transition which Auguste Comte considers to be the natural <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page408" id="v2page408">
</a>408</span>progress of the human mind: to explain phenomena at first by reference to some personal agency, and to pass from this mode of explanation to that by metaphysical abstractions. It is
true that these are two distinct modes of conceiving Causation; and that in each of them the human mind, under different states of social and individual instruction, finds satisfaction. But each of
the two theories admits of much diversity in the mode of conception. Plato seems to have first given prominence to these metaphysical causes; and Aristotle in this respect follows his example: though
he greatly censures the incomplete and erroneous theories of Plato. It is remarkable that both these two philosophers recognised Causes irregular and unpredictable, as well as Causes regular and
predictable. Neither of them included even the idea of regularity, as an essential part of the meaning of Cause.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_75" href="#Footnotev2_25_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a>
Lastly, there has been elaborated in modern times, owing to the great extension of inductive science, another theory of Causation, in which unconditional regularity is the essential constituent:
recognising no true Causes except the phenomenal causes certified by experience, as interpreted inductively and deductively &mdash; the assemblage of phenomenal antecedents, uniform and
unconditional, so far as they can be discovered and verified. <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page409" id="v2page409"></a>409</span>Certain it is that these are the only causes obtainable by
induction and experience: though many persons are not satisfied without looking elsewhere for transcendental or ontological causes of a totally different nature. All these theories imply &mdash; what
Sokrates announces in the passage just cited &mdash; the deep-seated influence of speculative curiosity, or the thirst for finding the Why of things and events, as a feeling of the human mind: but
all of them indicate the discrepant answers with which, in different enquirers, this feeling is satisfied, though under the same equivocal name <i>Cause</i>. And it would have been a proceeding
worthy of Plato&rsquo;s dialectic, if he had applied to the word Cause the same cross-examining analysis which we have seen him applying to the equally familiar words &mdash; Virtue &mdash; Courage
&mdash; Temperance &mdash; Friendship, &amp;c. &ldquo;First, let us settle what a Cause really is: then, and not till then, can we succeed in ulterior enquiries respecting it.&rdquo;<a name=

appears to have been the first of the Ionic School that introduced <i>formal causes</i> into natural philosophy. These he called <i>Ideas</i>, and made the principles of all things. And the reason
why he insists so much upon this kind of cause, and so little upon the other three, is given us by Aristotle in the end of his first book of Metaphysics, <i>viz.</i>, that he studied mathematics too
much, and instead of using them as the handmaid of philosophy, made them philosophy itself.&hellip; Plato, however, in the Ph&aelig;don says a good deal about final causes; but in the system of
natural philosophy which is in the Tim&aelig;us, he says very little of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have already observed that Plato in the Tim&aelig;us (48 A) recognises erratic or irregular Causation &mdash; &#7969; &pi;&lambda;&alpha;&nu;&omega;&mu;&#941;&nu;&eta;
&alpha;&#7984;&tau;&#943;&alpha;. Aristotle recognises &Alpha;&#7984;&tau;&#943;&alpha; among the equivocal words &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&chi;&#8182;&sigmaf;
&lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&#972;&mu;&epsilon;&nu;&alpha;; and he enumerates &Tau;&#973;&chi;&eta; and &Alpha;&#8016;&tau;&#972;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&nu; &mdash; irregular causes or causes by
accident &mdash; among them (Physic. ii. 195-198; Metaphys. K. 1065, a.) Schwegler, ad Aristot. Metaphys. vi. 4, 3, &ldquo;Das Zuf&auml;llige ist ein nothwendiges Element alles Geschehens&rdquo;.
Alexander of Aphrodisias, the best of the Aristotelian commentators, is at pains to defend this view of &Tau;&#973;&chi;&eta; &mdash; Causation by accident, or irregular.</p>

<p>Proklus, in his Commentary on the Tim&aelig;us (ii. 80-81, p. 188, Schneider), notices the labour and prolixity with which the commentators before him set out the different varieties of Cause;
distinguishing sixty-four according to Plato, and forty-eight according to Aristotle. Proklus adverts also (ad Tim&aelig;um, iii. p. 176) to an animated controversy raised by Theophrastus against
Plato, about Causes and the speculations thereupon.</p>

<p>An enumeration, though very incomplete, of the different meanings assigned to the word Cause, may be seen in Professor Fleming&rsquo;s Vocabulary of Philosophy.</p>

The debates about what was meant in philosophy by the word Cause are certainly older than Plato. We read that it was discussed among the philosophers who frequented the house of Perikles; and that
that eminent statesman was ridiculed by his dissolute son Xanthippus for taking part in such useless refinements (Plutarch, Perikles, c. 36). But the Platonic dialogues are the oldest compositions in
which any attempts to analyse the meaning of the word are preserved to us.</p>

the ancient speculative philosophers. While all of them set to themselves the same problem, each of them hit upon a different solution. That which gave mental satisfaction to one, appeared
unsatisfactory and even inadmissible to the rest. The first book of Aristotle&rsquo;s Metaphysica gives an instructive view of this discrepancy. His own analysis of Cause will come before us
hereafter. Compare the long discussions on the subject in Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrhon. Hypo. iii. 13-30; and adv. Mathemat. ix. 195-250. The discrepancy was so great among the dogmatical philosophers,
that he pronounces the reality of the causal sequence to be indeterminable &mdash; &#8005;&sigma;&omicron;&nu; &mu;&#8050;&nu; &omicron;&#8022;&nu; &#7952;&pi;&#8054; &tau;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf;

<p>The quadruple variety of Causation established by Aristotle governed the speculations of philosophers during the middle ages. But since the decline of the Aristotelian philosophy, there are few
subjects which have been more keenly debated among metaphysicians than the Idea of Cause. It is one of the principal points of divergence among the different schools of philosophy now existing. A
volume, and a very instructive volume, might be filled with the enumeration and contrast of the different theories on the subject. Upon the view which a man takes on this point will depend mainly the
scope or purpose which he sets before him in philosophy. Many seek the solution of their problem in transcendental, ontological, extra-phenomenal causes, lying apart from and above the world of fact
and experience; Reid and Stewart, while acknowledging the existence of such causes as the true efficient causes, consider them as being out of the reach of human knowledge; others recognise no true
cause except personal, quasi-human, voluntary, agency, grounded on the type of human volition. Others, again, with whom my own opinion coincides, following out the analysis of Hume and Brown,
understand by causes nothing more than phenomenal antecedents constant and unconditional, ascertainable by experience and induction. See the copious and elaborate chapter on this subject in Mr. John
Stuart Mill&rsquo;s &lsquo;System of Logic,&rsquo; Book iii. ch. 5, especially as enlarged in the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of that work, including the criticism on the opposite or volitional
theory of Causation; also the work of Professor Bain, &lsquo;The Emotions and the Will,&rsquo; pp. 472-584. The opposite view, in which Causes are treated as something essentially distinct from Laws,
and as ultra-phenomenal, is set forth by Dr. Whewell, &lsquo;Novum Organon Renovatum,&rsquo; ch. vii. p. 118 seq.</p>

<p>There is yet another point which deserves attention in this history given by Sokrates of the transitions of his own mind. His last transition is represented as one from things to words, that is, to
general propositions:<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_77" href="#Footnotev2_25_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> to the assumption in each case of an universal proposition or hypothesis calculated to fit that

principle from which to deduce consequences. Even if it were so, however, it was one and the same assumption intended to suit all cases: whereas the new doctrine to which he passed included many
distinct assumptions, each adapted to a certain number of cases and not to the rest.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_78" href="#Footnotev2_25_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> He assumed an untold multitude

this assumed hypothesis, and examined whether all of them were consistent or inconsistent with each other. If he detected inconsistencies (as <i>e.g.</i> in the last half of the Parmenid&ecirc;s), we
must suppose (though Plato does not expressly say so) that he would reject or modify his fundamental assumption: if he found none, he would retain it. The point would have to be tried by dialectic
debate with an opponent: the logical process of inference and counter-inference is here assumed to be trustworthy. But during this debate Plato would require his opponent to admit the truth of the
fundamental hypothesis provisionally. If the opponent chose to impugn the latter, he must open a distinct debate on that express subject. Plato insists that the discussion of the consequences flowing
from the hypothesis, shall be kept quite apart from the discussion on the credibility of the hypothesis itself. From the language employed, he seems to have had in view certain disputants known to
him, by whom the two were so blended together as to produce much confusion in the reasoning.</p>

Gen. et Corrupt. ii. 9, p. 335, b. 10, also Metaphys. A. 991, b. 3. The former passage is the most animated in point of expression, where Aristotle says &mdash; &#8037;&sigma;&pi;&epsilon;&rho;

true about the Platonic dialogue <i>Ph&aelig;don</i>, &amp;c. But in both the two passages, Aristotle distinctly maintains that the Ideas cannot be <i>Causes</i> of any thing.</p>

<p>This is another illustration of what I have observed above, that the meaning of the word <i>Cause</i> has been always fluctuating and undetermined.</p>

<p>We see that, while Aristotle affirmed that the Ideas could not be Causes of anything, Plato here maintains that they are the only true Causes.</p>

<p>But if your opponent impugns the hypothesis itself, how are you to defend it? Plato here tells us: by means of some other hypothesis or assumption, yet more universal than itself. You must ascend
upwards in the scale of generality, until you find an assumption suitable and sufficient.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_80" href="#Footnotev2_25_80"><span class="sp">80</span></a></p>

</div>

<p>We here see where it was that Plato looked for full, indisputable, self-recommending and self-assuring, certainty and truth. Among the most universal propositions. He states the matter here as if
we were to provide defence for an hypothesis less universal by ascending to another hypothesis more universal. This is illustrated by what he says in the Tim&aelig;us &mdash; Propositions are cognate
with the matter which they affirm: those whose affirmation is purely intellectual, comprising only matter of the intelligible world, or of genuine Essence, are solid and inexpugnable: those which
take in more or less of the sensible world, which is a mere copy of the intelligible exemplar, become less and less trustworthy &mdash; mere probabilities. Here we have the Platonic worship of the
most universal propositions, as the only primary <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page412" id="v2page412"></a>412</span>and evident truths.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_81" href="#Footnotev2_25_81"><span
class="sp">81</span></a> But in the sixth and seventh books of the Republic, he delivers a precept somewhat different, requiring the philosopher not to rest in any hypothesis as an ultimatum, but to
consider them all as stepping-stones for enabling him to ascend into a higher region, above all hypothesis &mdash; to the first principle of every thing: and he considers geometrical reasoning as
defective because it takes its departure from hypothesis or assumptions of which no account is rendered.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_82" href="#Footnotev2_25_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a> In the
Republic he thus contemplates an intuition by the mind of some primary, clear, self-evident truth, above all hypotheses or assumptions even the most universal, and transmitting its own certainty to
every thing which could be logically deduced from it: while in the Ph&aelig;don, he does not recognise any thing higher or more certain than the most universal hypothesis &mdash; and he even presents
the theory of self-existent Ideas as nothing more than an hypothesis, though a very satisfactory one. In the Republic, Plato has come to imagine the Idea of Good as distinguished from and
illuminating all the other Ideas: in the Tim&aelig;us, it seems personified in the Demiurgus; in the Ph&aelig;don, that Idea of Good appears to be represented by the Nous or Reason of Anaxagoras. But
Sokrates is unable to follow it out, so that it becomes included, without any pre-eminence, among the Ideas generally: all of them transcendental, co-ordinate, and primary sources of truth to the
intelligent mind &mdash; yet each of them exercising a causative influence in its own department, and bestowing its own special character on various particulars.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_33" id="Sidenotev2_25_33"></a> Plato&rsquo;s demonstration of the immortality of the soul rests upon the assumption of the Platonic ideas. Reasoning
to prove this.</span></p>

<p>It is from the assumption of these Ideas as eternal Essences, that Plato undertakes to demonstrate the immortality of the soul. One Idea or Form will not admit, but peremptorily excludes, the
approach of that other <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page413" id="v2page413"></a>413</span>Form which is opposite to it. Greatness will not receive the form of littleness: nor will the greatness
which is in any particular subject receive the form of littleness. If the form of littleness be brought to bear, greatness will not stay to receive it, but will either retire or be destroyed. The
same is true likewise respecting that which essentially has the form: thus fire has essentially the form of heat, and snow has essentially the form of cold. Accordingly fire, as it will not receive
the form of cold, so neither will it receive snow: and snow, as it will not receive the form of heat, so neither will it receive fire. If fire comes, snow will either retire or will be destroyed. The
Triad has always the Form of Oddness, and will never receive that of Evenness: the Dyad has always the Form of Evenness, and will never receive that of Oddness &mdash; upon the approach of this
latter it will either disappear or will be destroyed: moreover the Dyad, while refusing to receive the Form of Oddness, will refuse also to receive that of the Triad, which always embodies that Form
&mdash; although three is not in direct contrariety with two. If then we are asked, What is that, the presence of which makes a body hot? we need not confine ourselves to the answer &mdash; It is the
Form of Heat &mdash; which, though correct, gives no new information: but we may farther say &mdash; It is Fire, which involves the Form of Heat. If we are asked, What is that, the presence of which
makes a number odd, we shall not say &mdash; It is Oddness: but we shall say &mdash; It is the Triad or the Pentad &mdash; both of which involve Oddness.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_34" id="Sidenotev2_25_34"></a> The soul always brings life, and is essentially living. It cannot receive death: in other words, it is
immortal.</span></p>

<p>In like manner, the question being asked, What is that, which, being in the body, will give it life? we must answer &mdash; It is the soul. The soul, when it lays hold of any body, always arrives
bringing with it life. Now death is the contrary of life. Accordingly the soul, which always brings with it life, will never receive the contrary of life. In other words, it is deathless or
immortal.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_83" href="#Footnotev2_25_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a></p>

<p>Nemesius, the Christian bishop of Emesa, declares that the proofs given by Plato of the immortality of the soul are knotty and difficult to understand, such as even adepts in philosophical study
can hardly follow. His own belief in it he rests upon the inspiration of the Christian Scriptures (Nemesius de Nat. Homin. c. 2. p. 55, ed. 1565).</p>

as well as post-existence &mdash; animals as well as man &mdash; also the metempsychosis or translation of the soul from one body to another.</span></p>

<p>Such is the ground upon which Sokrates rests his belief in the immortality of the soul. The doctrine reposes, in Plato&rsquo;s view, upon the assumption of eternal, self-existent, unchangeable,
Ideas or Forms:<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_84" href="#Footnotev2_25_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a> upon the congeniality of nature, and inherent correlation, between these Ideas and the Soul: upon the
fact, that the soul knows these Ideas, which knowledge must have been acquired in a prior state of existence: and upon the essential participation of the soul in the Idea of life, so that it cannot
be conceived as without life, or as dead.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_85" href="#Footnotev2_25_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a> The immortality of the soul is conceived as necessary and entire, including
not merely post-existence, but also pre-existence. In fact the reference to an anterior time is more essential to Plato&rsquo;s theory than that to a posterior time; because it is employed to explain
the cognitions of the mind, and the identity of learning with reminiscence: while Simmias, who even at the close is not without <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page415" id="v2page415">
</a>415</span>reserve on the subject of the post-existence, proclaims an emphatic adhesion on that of the pre-existence.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_86" href="#Footnotev2_25_86"><span class=
"sp">86</span></a> The proof, moreover, being founded in great part on the Idea of Life, embraces every thing living, and is common to animals<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_87" href="#Footnotev2_25_87"><span
class="sp">87</span></a> (if not to plants) as well as to men: and the metempsychosis &mdash; or transition of souls not merely from one human body to another, but also from the human to the animal
body, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i> &mdash; is a portion of the Platonic creed.</p>

Beweis f&uuml;r die Unsterblichkeit, laufen nicht bloss alle die einzelnen Beweise des Ph&aelig;don zusammen, sondern derselbe wird auch schon im Phaedrus vorgetragen,&rdquo; &amp;c. Compare
Ph&aelig;drus, p. 245.</p>

<p>Hegel, in his Geschichte der Philosophie (Part ii. pp. 186-187-189, ed. 2), maintains that Plato did not conceive the soul as a separate thing or reality &mdash; that he did not mean to affirm, in
the literal sense of the words, its separate existence either before or after the present life &mdash; that he did not descend to so crude a conception (zu dieser Rohheit herabzusinken) as to
represent to himself the soul as a thing, or to enquire into its duration or continuance after the manner of a thing &mdash; that Plato understood the soul to exist essentially as the Universal
Notion or Idea, the comprehensive aggregate of all other Ideas, in which sense he affirmed it to be immortal &mdash; that the descriptions which Plato gives of its condition, either before life or
after death, are to be treated only as poetical metaphors. There is ingenuity in this view of Hegel, and many separate expressions of Plato receive light from it: but it appears to me to refine away
too much. Plato had in his own mind and belief both the soul as a particular thing &mdash; and the soul as an universal. His language implies sometimes the one sometimes the other.</p>

<p>Having completed his demonstration of the immortality of the soul, Sokrates proceeds to give a sketch of the condition and treatment which it experiences after death. The
&Nu;&epsilon;&kappa;&upsilon;&#943;&alpha; here following is analogous, in general doctrinal scope, to those others which we read in the Republic and in the Gorgias: but all of them are different in
particular incidents, illustrative circumstances, and scenery. The sentiment of belief in Plato&rsquo;s mind attaches itself to general doctrines, which appear to him to possess an evidence
independent of particulars. When he applies these doctrines to particulars, he makes little distinction between such as are true, or problematical, or fictitious: he varies his mythes at pleasure,
provided that they serve the purpose of illustrating his general view. The mythe which we read in the Ph&aelig;don includes a description of the Earth which to us appears altogether imaginative and
poetical: yet it is hardly more so than several other current theories, proposed by various philosophers antecedent and contemporary, respecting Earth and Sea. Aristotle criticises the views
expressed in the Ph&aelig;don, as he criticises those of Demokritus and Empedokles.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_88" href="#Footnotev2_25_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a> Each soul of a deceased person is

be a good imitation of the truth, Republ. x. 620 seq.; Gorgias, p. 520; Aristotle, Meteorol. ii. pp. 355-356. Compare also 356, b. 10, 357, a. 25, where he states and canvasses the doctrines of

others than upon Plato. He too considers, like Plato, that the amount of evidence which you ought to require for your belief depends upon the nature of the subject; and that there are various
subjects on which you ought to believe on slighter evidence: see Metaphysic. A. 995, a. 2-16: Ethic. Nikom. i. 1, 1094, b. 12-14.</p>

<p>Sokrates then retires with Kriton into an interior chamber to bathe, desiring that the women may be spared the task of washing his body after his decease. Having taken final leave of his wife and
children, he returns to his friends as sunset is approaching. We are here made to see the contrast between him and other prisoners under like circumstances. The attendant of the Eleven Magistrates
comes to warn him that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page417" id="v2page417"></a>417</span>hour has come for swallowing the poison; expressing sympathy and regret for the necessity of
delivering so painful a message, together with admiration for the equanimity and rational judgment of Sokrates, which he contrasts forcibly with the discontent and wrath of other prisoners under
similar circumstances. As he turned away with tears in his eyes, Sokrates exclaimed &mdash; &ldquo;How courteous the man is to me and has been from the beginning! how generously he now weeps for me!
Let us obey him, and let the poison be brought forthwith, if it be prepared: if not, let him prepare it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do not hurry&rdquo; (interposed Kriton): &ldquo;there is still time, for the sun
is not quite set. I have known others who, even after receiving the order, deferred drinking the poison until they had had a good supper and other enjoyments.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is natural that they
should do so&rdquo; (replied Sokrates). &ldquo;They think that they are gainers by it: for me, it is natural that I should not do so &mdash; for I shall gain nothing but contempt in my own eyes, by
thus clinging to life, and saving up when there is nothing left.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_93" href="#Footnotev2_25_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a></p>

<p>Kriton accordingly gave orders, and the poison, after a certain interval, was brought in. Sokrates, on asking for directions, was informed, that after having swallowed it, he must walk about until
his legs felt heavy: he must then lie down and cover himself up: the poison would do its work. He took the cup without any symptom of alarm or change of countenance: then looking at the attendant
with his usual full and fixed gaze, he asked whether there was enough to allow of a libation. &ldquo;We prepare as much as is sufficient&rdquo; (was the answer), &ldquo;but no more.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
understand&rdquo; (said Sokrates): &ldquo;but at least I may pray, and I must pray, to the Gods, that my change of abode from here to there may be fortunate.&rdquo; He then put the cup to his lips,

<p>His friends, who had hitherto maintained their self-control, were overpowered by emotion on seeing the cup swallowed, and broke out into violent tears and lamentation. No one was unmoved, except
Sokrates himself:<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page418" id="v2page418"></a>418</span> who gently remonstrated with them, and exhorted them to tranquil resignation: reminding them that nothing but
good words was admissible at the hour of death. The friends, ashamed of themselves, found means to repress their tears. Sokrates walked about until he felt heavy in the legs, and then lay down in
bed. After some interval, the attendant of the prison came to examine his feet and legs, pinched his foot with force, and enquired whether he felt it. Sokrates replied in the negative. Presently the
man pinched his legs with similar result, and showed to the friends in that way that his body was gradually becoming chill and benumbed: adding that as soon as this should get to the heart, he would
die.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_95" href="#Footnotev2_25_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a> The chill had already reached his belly, when Sokrates uncovered his face, which had been hitherto concealed by

reply, but again covered himself up.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_97" href="#Footnotev2_25_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> After a short interval, he made some movement: the attendant presently uncovered
him, and found him dead, with his eyes stiff and fixed. Kriton performed the last duty of closing both his eyes and his mouth.</p>

medicinam fecisse videatur. Cui quidem Deo, quemadmodum tu soles, pi&eacute; et cast&eacute; satisfacies: id est, Apollini et &AElig;sculapio.&rdquo; Compare the rhetor Aristeides, Orat. xlv. pp.
22-23-155, ed. Dindorf. About the habit of sacrificing a cock to &AElig;sculapius, see also a passage in the &#7993;&epsilon;&rho;&#8182;&nu; &Lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&iota; of the rhetor
Aristeides (Orat. xxvii. p. 545, ed. Dindorf, at the top of the page). I will add that the five &#7993;&epsilon;&rho;&#8182;&nu; &Lambda;&#972;&gamma;&omicron;&iota; of that Rhetor (Oratt.
xxiii.-xxvii.) are curious as testifying the multitude of dreams and revelations vouchsafed to him by &AElig;sculapius; also the implicit faith with which he acted upon them in his maladies, and the
success which attended the curative prescriptions thus made known to him. Aristeides declares himself to place more confidence in these revelations than in the advice of physicians, and to have often
acted on them in preference to such advice (Orat. xlv. pp. 20-22, Dind.).</p>

<p>The direction here given by Sokrates to Kriton (though some critics, even the most recent, see Krische, Lehren der Griechischen Denker, p. 227, interpret it in a mystical sense) is to be
understood simply and literally, in my judgment. On what occasion, or for what, he had made the vow of the cock, we are not told. Sokrates was a very religious man, much influenced by prophecies,
oracles, dreams, and special revelations (Plato, Apol. Sokr. pp. 21-29-33; also Ph&aelig;don, p. 60).</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_41" id="Sidenotev2_25_41"></a> Extreme pathos, and probable trustworthiness of these personal details.</span></p>

<p>The pathetic details of this scene &mdash; arranged with so much dramatic beauty, and lending imperishable interest to the Ph&aelig;don of Plato &mdash; may be regarded as real facts, described
from the recollection of an eye-witness, though many years after their occurrence. They present to us the personality of Sokrates in full harmony with that which we read in the Platonic Apology. The
tranquil ascendancy of resolute and rational conviction, satisfied with the past, and welcoming instead of fearing the close of life &mdash; is exhibited as triumphing in the one case over adverse
accusers and judges, in the other case over the unnerving manifestations of afflicted friends.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sidenotev2_25_42" id="Sidenotev2_25_42"></a> Contrast between the Platonic Apology and the Ph&aelig;don.</span></p>

<p>But though the personal incidents of this dialogue are truly Sokratic &mdash; the dogmatic emphasis, and the apparatus of argument and hypothesis, are essentially Platonic. In these respects, the
dialogue contrasts remarkably with the Apology. When addressing the Dikasts, Sokrates not only makes no profession of dogmatic certainty, but expressly disclaims it. Nay more &mdash; he considers
that the false persuasion of such dogmatic certainty, universally prevalent among his countrymen, is as pernicious as it is illusory: and that his own superiority over others consists merely in
consciousness of his own ignorance, while they are unconscious of theirs.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_98" href="#Footnotev2_25_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a> To dissipate such false persuasion of
knowledge, by perpetual cross-examination of every one around, is the special mission imposed upon him by the Gods: in which mission, indeed, he has the firmest belief &mdash; but it is a belief,
like <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page420" id="v2page420"></a>420</span>that in his D&aelig;mon or divine sign, depending upon oracles, dreams, and other revelations peculiar to himself, which he
does not expect that the Dikasts will admit as genuine evidence.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_99" href="#Footnotev2_25_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a> One peculiar example, whereby Sokrates exemplifies
the false persuasion of knowledge where men have no real knowledge, is borrowed from the fear of death. No man knows (he says) what death is, not even whether it may not be a signal benefit: yet
every man fears it as if he well knew that it was the greatest evil.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_100" href="#Footnotev2_25_100"><span class="sp">100</span></a> Death must be one of two things: either a
final extinction &mdash; a perpetual and dreamless sleep &mdash; or else a transference of the soul to some other place. Sokrates is persuaded that it will be in either case a benefit to him, and
that the Gods will take care that he, a good man, shall suffer no evil, either living or dead: the proof of which is, to him, that the divine sign has <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page421" id=
"v2page421"></a>421</span>never interposed any obstruction in regard to his trial and sentence. If (says he) I am transferred to some other abode, among those who have died before me, how delightful
will it be to see Homer and Hesiod, Orpheus and Mus&aelig;us, Agamemnon, Ajax or Palam&ecirc;des &mdash; and to pass my time in cross-examining each as to his true or false knowledge!<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_25_101" href="#Footnotev2_25_101"><span class="sp">101</span></a> Lastly, so far as he professes to aim at any positive end, it is the diffusion of political, social, human virtue, as
distinguished from acquisitions above the measure of humanity. He tells men that it is not wealth which produces virtue, but virtue which produces wealth and other advantages, both public and
private.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_102" href="#Footnotev2_25_102"><span class="sp">102</span></a></p>

<p>In the Xenophontic Apology of Sokrates, no allusion is made to the immortality of the soul. Sokrates is there described as having shaped his defence under a belief that he had arrived at a term
when it was better for him to die than to live, and that prolonged life would only expose him to the unavoidable weaknesses and disabilities of senility. It is a proof of the benevolence of the Gods
that he is withdrawn from life at so opportune a moment. This is the explanation which Xenophon gives of the haughty tone of the defence (sects. 6-15-23-27). In the Xenophontic Cyrop&aelig;dia,
Cyrus, on his death-bed, addresses earnest exhortations to his two sons: and to give greater force to such exhortations, reminds them that his own soul will still survive and will still exercise a
certain authority after his death. He expresses his own belief not only that the soul survives the body, but also that it becomes more rational when disembodied; because &mdash; 1. Murderers are
disturbed by the souls of murdered men. 2. Honours are paid to deceased persons, which practice would not continue, unless the souls of the deceased had efficacy to enforce it. 3. The souls of living
men are more rational during sleep than when awake, and sleep affords the nearest analogy to death (viii. 7, 17-21). (Much the same arguments were urged in the dialogues of Aristotle. Bernays,
Dialog. Aristot. pp. 23-105.) He however adds, that even if he be mistaken in this point, and if his soul perish with his body, still he conjures his sons, in the name of the gods, to obey his dying
injunctions (s. 22). Again, he says (s. 27), &ldquo;Invite all the Persians to my tomb, to join with me in satisfaction that I shall now be in safety, so as to suffer no farther harm, whether I am
united to the divine element, or perish altogether&rdquo; (&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&eta;&sigma;&theta;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&mu;&#941;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf; &#7952;&mu;&omicron;&#943;,
&#8005;&tau;&iota; &#7952;&nu; &tau;&#8183; &#7936;&sigma;&phi;&alpha;&lambda;&epsilon;&#8150; &#7972;&delta;&eta; &#7956;&sigma;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&iota;, &#8033;&sigmaf;

The view taken here by Cyrus, of death in its analogy with sleep (&#8021;&pi;&nu;&#8179; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &theta;&alpha;&nu;&#940;&tau;&#8179;
&delta;&iota;&delta;&upsilon;&mu;&#940;&omicron;&sigma;&iota;&nu;, Iliad, xvi. 672) as a refuge against impending evil for the future, is much the same as that taken by Sokrates in his Apology.
Sokrates is not less proud of his past life, spent in dialectic debate, than Cyrus of his glorious exploits. &#8009; &theta;&#940;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;, &lambda;&iota;&mu;&#8052;&nu;

the Apology.</span></p>

<p>If from the Apology we turn to the Ph&aelig;don, we seem to pass, not merely to the same speaker after the interval of one month (the ostensible interval indicated) but to a different speaker and
over a long period. We have Plato speaking through the mouth of Sokrates, and Plato too at a much later time.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_103" href="#Footnotev2_25_103"><span class="sp">103</span></a>
Though the moral character (&#7974;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;) of Sokrates is fully maintained and even strikingly dramatised &mdash; the intellectual personality is altogether transformed. Instead of
a speaker who avows his own ignorance, and blames others only for believing themselves to know when they are equally ignorant &mdash; we have one who indulges in the widest range of theory and the
boldest employment of hypothesis. Plato introduces his own dogmatical and mystical views, leaning in part on the Orphic and Pythagorean creeds.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_104" href=
"#Footnotev2_25_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a> He declares the distinctness of nature, the incompatibility, the forced temporary union and active conflict, between the soul and the body. He
includes this in the still wider and more general declaration, which recognises antithesis between the two worlds: the world of Ideas, Forms, Essences, not perceivable but only cogitable, eternal,
and unchangeable, with which the soul or mind was in kindred and communion &mdash; the world of sense, or of transient and ever-changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page422" id=

only after knowledge and desires to look at things<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_105" href="#Footnotev2_25_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a> as they are in themselves, with his mind by itself &mdash; is
represented as desiring, throughout all his life, to loosen as much as possible the implication of his soul with his body, and as rejoicing when the hour of death arrives to divorce them
altogether.</p>

<p>Such total renunciation of the body is put, with dramatic propriety, into the mouth of Sokrates during the last hour of his life. But it would not have been in harmony with the character of
Sokrates as other Platonic dialogues present him &mdash; in the plenitude of life &mdash; manifesting distinguished bodily strength and soldierly efficiency, proclaiming gymnastic training for the
body to be co-ordinate with musical training for the mind, and impressed with the most intense admiration for the personal beauty of youth. The human body, which in the Ph&aelig;don is discredited as
a morbid incumbrance corrupting the purity of the soul, is presented to us by Sokrates in the Ph&aelig;drus as the only sensible object which serves as a mirror and reflection of the beauty of the
ideal world:<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_106" href="#Footnotev2_25_106"><span class="sp">106</span></a> while the Platonic Tim&aelig;us proclaims (in language not unsuitable to Locke) that sight, hearing,
and speech are the sources of our abstract Ideas, and the generating causes of speculative intellect and philosophy.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_107" href="#Footnotev2_25_107"><span class=

<span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page423" id="v2page423"></a>423</span>that death was no misfortune, but relief from a burthen. And Plato has availed himself of this impressive situation,<a name=
"FnAnchorv2_25_108" href="#Footnotev2_25_108"><span class="sp">108</span></a> to recommend, with every charm of poetical expression, various characteristic dogmas respecting the essential distinction
between Ideas and the intelligible world on one side &mdash; Perceptions and the sensible world on the other: respecting the soul, its nature akin to the intelligible world, its pre-existence
anterior to its present body, and its continued existence after the death of the latter: respecting the condition of the soul before birth and after death, its transition, in the case of most men,
into other bodies, either human or animal, with the condition of suffering penalties commensurate to the wrongs committed in this life: finally, respecting the privilege accorded to the souls of such
as have passed their lives in intellectual and philosophical occupation, that they shall after death remain for ever disembodied, in direct communion with the world of Ideas.</p>

<p>&AElig;schines, one of the Socratici viri or fellow disciples of Sokrates along with Plato, composed dialogues (of the same general nature as those of Plato) wherein Sokrates was introduced

pre-existence and the mode of post-existence, of the soul, would be quite undetermined.</span></p>

<p>The main part of Plato&rsquo;s argumentation, drawn from the general assumptions of his philosophy, is directed to prove the separate and perpetual existence of the soul, before as well as after
the body. These arguments, interesting as specimens of the reasoning which satisfied Plato, do not prove his conclusion.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_109" href="#Footnotev2_25_109"><span class=

posterior existence, would be altogether undetermined, and would be left to the free play of sentiment and imagination. There is no subject upon which the poetical genius of Plato has been more
abundantly exercised.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_110" href="#Footnotev2_25_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a> He has given us two different descriptions of the state of the soul before its junction with
the body (Tim&aelig;us, and Ph&aelig;drus), and three different descriptions of its destiny after separation from the body (Republic, Gorgias, Ph&aelig;don). In all the three, he supposes an
adjudication and classification of the departed souls, and a better or worse fate <span class="correction" title="amended from alloted">allotted</span> to each according to the estimate which he
forms of their merits or demerits during life: but in each of the three, this general idea is carried out by a different machinery. The Hades of Plato is not announced even by himself as anything
more than approximation to the truth: but it embodies his own ethical and judicial sentence on the classes of men around him &mdash; as the Divina Commedia embodies that of Dante on antecedent
individual persons. Plato distributes rewards and penalties in the measure which he conceives to be deserved: he erects his own approbation and disapprobation, his own sympathy and antipathy, into
laws of the unknown future state: the Gods, whom he postulates, are imaginary agents introduced to execute the sentences which he dictates. While others, in their conceptions of posthumous existence,
assured the happiest fate, sometimes even divinity itself, to great warriors and law-givers &mdash; to devoted friends and patriots like Harmodius and Aristogeiton &mdash; to the exquisite beauty of
Helen &mdash; or to favourites of the Gods like Ganym&ecirc;des or Pelops<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_111" href="#Footnotev2_25_111"><span class="sp">111</span></a> &mdash; Plato claims that supreme
distinction for the departed philosopher.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="fn"><a name="Footnotev2_25_109" id="Footnotev2_25_109"></a><a href="#FnAnchorv2_25_109">109</a></span> Wyttenbach has annexed to his edition of the Ph&aelig;don an
instructive review of the argumentation contained in it respecting the Immortality of the soul. He observes justly &mdash; &ldquo;Videamus jam de Ph&aelig;done, qui ab omni antiquitate is habitus est
liber, in quo rationes immortalitatis animarum gravissim&eacute; luculentissim&eacute;que exposita essent. Qu&aelig; quidem libro laus et auctoritas conciliata est, non tam firmitate argumentorum,
quam eloquenti&acirc; Platonis,&rdquo; &amp;c. (Disputat. De Placit. Immort. Anim. p. 10). The same feeling, substantially, is expressed by one of the disputants in Cicero&rsquo;s Tusculan
Disputations, who states that he assented to the reasoning while he was reading the dialogue, but that as soon as he had laid down the book, his assent all slipped away from him. I have already
mentioned that Pan&aelig;tius, an extreme admirer of Plato on most points, dissented from him about the immortality of the soul (Cicero, Tusc. Disp. i. 11, 24 &mdash; i. 32, 79), and declared the
Ph&aelig;don to be spurious. Galen also mentions (De Format. F&oelig;t&ucirc;s, vol. iv. pp. 700-702. K&uuml;hn) that he had written a special treatise (now lost) to prove that the reasonings in the
Ph&aelig;don were self-contradictory, and that he could not satisfy himself, either about the essence of the soul, or whether it was mortal or immortal. Compare his treatise &Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054;
&Omicron;&#8016;&sigma;&#943;&alpha;&sigmaf; &tau;&#8182;&nu; &phi;&upsilon;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&#8182;&nu; &delta;&upsilon;&nu;&#940;&mu;&epsilon;&omega;&nu; &mdash; iv. pp. 762-763 &mdash; and
&Pi;&epsilon;&rho;&#8054; &tau;&#8182;&nu; &tau;&#8134;&sigmaf; &psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#8134;&sigmaf; &#7968;&theta;&#8182;&nu;, iv. 773. In this last passage, he represents the opinion of Plato to be
&mdash; That the two inferior souls, the courageous and the appetitive, are mortal, in which he (Galen) agrees, and that the rational soul alone is immortal, of which he (Galen) is not persuaded. Now
this view of Plato&rsquo;s opinion is derived from the Republic and Tim&aelig;us, not from the Ph&aelig;don, in which last the triple soul is not acknowledged. We may thus partly understand the
inconsistencies, which Galen pointed out in his lost Treatise, in the argumentation of the Ph&aelig;don: wherein one of the proofs presented to establish the immortality of the soul is &mdash; That
the soul is inseparably and essentially identified with life, and cannot admit death (p. 105 D). This argument, if good at all, is just as good to prove the immortality of the two inferior souls, as
of the superior and rational soul. Galen might therefore remark that it did not consist with the conclusion which he drew from the Tim&aelig;us and the Republic.</p>

and purification suitable to the respective condition of each; after which they become attached to new bodies, sometimes of men, sometimes of other animals. Of this distributive scheme it is not
possible to frame any clear idea, nor is Plato consistent with himself except in a few material features. But one feature there is in it which stands conspicuous &mdash; the belief in the
metempsychosis, or transfer of the same soul from one animal body to another: a belief very widely diffused throughout the ancient world, associated with the immortality of the soul, pervading the

<p>Lactantius &mdash; in replying to the arguments of Demokritus, Epikurus, and Dik&aelig;archus against the immortality of the soul &mdash; reminded them that any <i>Magus</i> would produce visible
evidence to refute them; by calling up before them the soul of any deceased person to give information and predict the future &mdash; &ldquo;qui profecto non auderent de animarum interitu mago
praesente disserere, qui sciret certis carminibus cieri ab infernis animas et adesse et pr&aelig;bere se videndas et loqui et futura pr&aelig;dicere: et si auderent, re ips&acirc; et documentis
pr&aelig;sentibus vincerentur&rdquo; (Lactant. Inst. vii. 13). See Cicero, Tusc. Disp. i. 31.</p>

<p>The general doctrine, upon which the Metempsychosis rests, is set forth by Virgil in the fine lines which follow, 723-751; compare Georgic iv. 218. The souls of men, beasts, birds, and fishes, are
all of them detached fragments or portions from the universal soul, mind, or life, &aelig;therial or igneous, which pervades the whole Kosmos. The soul of each individual thus detached to be
conjoined with a distinct body, becomes tainted by such communion; after death it is purified by penalties, measured according to the greater or less taint, and becomes then fit to be attached to a
new body, yet not until it has drunk the water of L&ecirc;th&ecirc; (Plato, Phil&ecirc;bus, p. 30 A; Tim&aelig;us, p. 30 B).</p>

<p>The statement of Nemesius is remarkable, that all Greeks who believed the immortality of the soul, believed also in the metempsychosis &mdash; &Kappa;&omicron;&iota;&nu;&#8135; &mu;&#8050;&nu;
&omicron;&#8022;&nu; &pi;&#940;&nu;&tau;&epsilon;&sigmaf; &#7964;&lambda;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;, &omicron;&#7985; &tau;&#8052;&nu; &psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#8052;&nu;

cap. ii. p. 50, ed. 1565). Plato accepted the Egyptian and Pythagorean doctrine, continued in the Orphic mysteries (Arnob. adv. Gentes, ii. 16), making no essential distinction between the souls of
men and those of animals, and recognising reciprocal interchange from the one to the other. The Platonists adhered to this doctrine fully, down to the third century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,
including Plotinus, Numenius, and others. But Porphyry, followed by Jamblichus, introduced a modification of this creed, denying the possibility of transition of a human soul into the body of another
animal, or of the soul of any other animal into the body of a man, &mdash; yet still recognising the transition from one human body to another, and from one animal body to another. (See Alkinous,
Introd. in Platon. c. 25.) This subject is well handled in a learned work published in 1712 by a Jesuit of Toulouse, Michel Mourgues. He shows (in opposition to Dacier and others, who interpreted the
doctrine in a sense merely spiritual and figurative) that the metempsychosis was a literal belief of the Platonists down to the time of Proklus. &ldquo;Les quatre Platoniciens qui ont tenu la
Transmigration born&eacute;e&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> from one human body into another human body) &ldquo;n&rsquo;ont pas laiss&eacute; d&rsquo;admettre la pluralit&eacute; d&rsquo;animations ou de vies
d&rsquo;une m&ecirc;me &acirc;me: et cela sans figure et sans m&eacute;taphore. Cet article, qui est l&rsquo;essentiel, n&rsquo;a jamais trouv&eacute; un seul contradicteur dans les sectes qui ont
cru l&rsquo;&acirc;me immortelle: ni Porphyre, ni Hi&eacute;rocle, ni Procle, ni Salluste, n&rsquo;ont jamais touch&eacute; &agrave; ce point que pour l&rsquo;approuver. D&rsquo;o&ugrave; il suit que
la r&eacute;alit&eacute; de la M&eacute;tempsychose est indubitable; c&rsquo;est &agrave; dire, qu&rsquo;il est indubitable que tous les sectateurs de Pythagore et de Platon l&rsquo;ont soutenue dans
un sens tr&egrave;s r&eacute;el quant &agrave; la pluralit&eacute; des vies et d&rsquo;animations&rdquo; (Tom. i. p. 525: also Tom. ii. p. 432) M. Cousin and M. Barth&eacute;lemy St Hilaire are of
the same opinion.</p>

<p>M. Barth&eacute;lemy St. Hilaire observes in his Premier M&eacute;moire sur le Sankhy&acirc; p. 416, Paris, 1852.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave; donc la transmigration dans les plus grands dialogues de Platon &mdash; le Tim&eacute;e, la R&eacute;publique, le Ph&egrave;dre, le Ph&eacute;don. On peut en retrouver la trace
manifeste dans d&rsquo;autres dialogues moins consid&eacute;rables, le Menon et le Politique, par exemple. La transmigration est m&ecirc;me positivement indiqu&eacute;e dans le dixi&egrave;me Livre
des Lois, o&ugrave; Platon traite avec tant de force et de solennit&eacute; de la providence et de la justice divines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;En pr&eacute;sence de t&eacute;moignages si s&eacute;rieux, et de tant de persistance &agrave; revenir sur des opinions qui ne varient pas, je crois que tout esprit sens&eacute; ne peut que
partager l&rsquo;avis de M. Cousin. Il est impossible que Platon ne se fasse de l&rsquo;exposition de ces opinions qu&rsquo;un pur badinage. Il les a r&eacute;pet&eacute;es, sans les modifier en
rien, au milieu des discussions les plus graves et les plus &eacute;tendues. Ajoutez que ces doctrines tiennent intim&eacute;ment &agrave; toutes celles qui sont le fond m&ecirc;me du platonisme, et
qu&rsquo;elles s&rsquo;y entrelacent si &eacute;troitement, que les en d&eacute;tacher, c&rsquo;est le mutiler et l&rsquo;amoindrir. Le syst&egrave;me des Id&eacute;es ne se comprend pas tout entier
sans la r&eacute;miniscence: et la r&eacute;miniscence elle m&ecirc;me implique necessairement l&rsquo;existence ant&eacute;rieure de l&rsquo;&acirc;me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Henry More, in his &lsquo;Treatise on the Immortality of the Soul,&rsquo; argues at considerable length in defence of pre-existence of each soul, as a part of the doctrine. He considers
himself to have clearly proved &mdash; &ldquo;That the pre-existence of the soul is an opinion both in itself the most rational that can be maintained, and has had the suffrage of the most renowned
philosophers in all ages of the world&rdquo;. Of these last-mentioned philosophers he gives a list, as follows &mdash; Moses, on the authority of the Jewish Cabbala &mdash; Zoroaster, Pythagoras,
Epicharmus, Empedocles, Ceb&ecirc;s, Euripides, Plato, Euclid, Philo, Virgil, Marcus Cicero, Plotinus, Jamblichus, Proclus, Boethius, &amp;c. See chapters xii. and xiii. pages 116, 117, 121 of his
Treatise. Compare also what he says in Sect. 18 of his Preface General, page xx.-xxiv.</p>

of the soul did not appear satisfactory to subsequent philosophers. The question remained debated and problematical.</span></p>

<p>We are told that one vehement admirer of Plato &mdash; the Ambrakiot Kleombrotus &mdash; was so profoundly affected and convinced by reading the Ph&aelig;don, that he immediately terminated his
existence by leaping from a high wall; though in other respects well satisfied with life. But the number of persons who derived from it such settled conviction, was certainly not considerable.
Neither the doctrine nor the reasonings of Plato were adopted even by the immediate successors in his school: still less by Aristotle and the Peripatetics &mdash; or by the Stoics &mdash; or by the
Epikureans. The Epikureans denied altogether the survivorship of soul over body: Aristotle gives a definition of the soul which involves this same negation, though he admits as credible the separate
existence of the rational soul, without individuality or personality. The Stoics, while affirming the soul to <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page427" id="v2page427"></a>427</span>be material as
well as the body, considered it as a detached fragment of the all-pervading cosmical or mundane soul, which was re-absorbed after the death of the individual into the great whole to which it
belonged. None of these philosophers were persuaded by the arguments of Plato. The popular orthodoxy, which he often censures harshly, recognised some sort of posthumous existence as a part of its
creed; and the uninquiring multitude continued in the teaching and traditions of their youth. But literary and philosophical men, who sought to form some opinion for themselves without altogether
rejecting (as the Epikureans rejected) the basis of the current traditions &mdash; were in no better condition for deciding the question with the assistance of Plato, than they would have been
without him. While the knowledge of the bodily organism, and of mind or soul as embodied therein, received important additions, from Aristotle down to Galen &mdash; no new facts either were known or
could become known, respecting soul <i>per se</i>, considered as pre-existent or post-existent to body. Galen expressly records his dissatisfaction with Plato on this point, though generally among
his warmest admirers. Questions of this kind remained always problematical, standing themes for rhetoric or dialectic.<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_114" href="#Footnotev2_25_114"><span class=
"sp">114</span></a> Every man could do, <span class="pagenum"><a name="v2page428" id="v2page428"></a>428</span>though not with the same exuberant eloquence, what Plato had done &mdash; and no man
could do more. Every man could coin his own hopes and fears, his own &aelig;sthetical preferences and repugnances, his own ethical aspiration to distribute rewards and punishments among the
characters around him &mdash; into affirmative prophecies respecting an unknowable future, where neither verification nor Elenchus were accessible. The state of this discussion throughout the Pagan
world bears out the following remark of Lord Macaulay, with which I conclude the present chapter:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are branches of knowledge with respect to which the law of the human mind is progress.&hellip; But with theology, the case is very different. As respects natural religion &mdash;
revelation being for the present altogether left out of the question &mdash; it is not easy to see that a philosopher of the present day is more favourably situated than Thales or Simonides.&hellip;
As to the other great question &mdash; the question, what becomes of man after death &mdash; we do not see that a highly educated European, left to his unassisted reason, is more likely to be in the
right than a Blackfoot Indian. Not a single one of the many sciences in which we surpass the Blackfoot Indians, throws the smallest light on the state of the soul after the animal life is extinct. In
truth, all the philosophers, ancient and modern, who have attempted, without the help of revelation, to prove the immortality of man &mdash; from Plato down to Franklin &mdash; appear to us to have
failed deplorably. Then again, all the great enigmas which perplex the natural theologian are the same in all ages. The ingenuity of a people just emerging from barbarism, is quite sufficient to
propound them. The genius of Locke or Clarke is quite unable to solve them.&hellip; Natural Theology, then, is not a progressive science.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchorv2_25_115" href=

   <h4>Transcriber&rsquo;s Note</h4>
   <p>This HTML version was prepared initially for the on-line Grote Project by Ed Brandon from volumes in the Internet Archive. It owes a very great deal (its style sheet) to the Project Gutenberg versions of the 1911 <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> produced by Don Kretz and others. Don provided a revised style for the side-notes to accommodate Grote&rsquo;s predilection for very long notes. (Even so there are a few occasions where the appearance may yet be bad in some browsers because the side-note extends over more lines than its accompanying paragraph. If there are also footnotes in the paragraph I have had to guess at how much blank space should be inserted for the footnote not to overlap the side-note.) I have modified it in one respect to permit Grote&rsquo;s use of italics in some side-notes.</p>
